## Our mission

Our mission is to support and challenge the Civil Service to become the most inclusive employer for LGBT+ people in the country.

We are a volunteer-led network based all over the UK. Our volunteers develop policy, organise and deliver social, networking and learning events, and promote diversity and inclusion of LGBT+ staff.
