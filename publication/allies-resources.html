  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>A​l​l​i​e​s​ are essential to help create inclusive and supportive workplace environments for LGBT+ employees.</p>

  <p>In the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, we want everyone to feel included and valued for who they are. We know that LGBT+ Civil Servants may feel less included and more at risk of discrimination than their cisgender and heterosexual peers.</p>

  <p>However, cisgender and heterosexual/straight Civil Servants can act as allies to support LGBT+ colleagues, raise awareness and encourage equality in the workplace.</p>

  <p>Likewise, being an ally is not limited to being cisgender or straight. LGBT+ colleagues can act as allies to each other, for both those who identify the same as them or differently from them.</p>

  <h2 id="why-do-we-need-allies-in-the-workplace">Why do we need allies in the workplace?</h2>

  <p>The ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2019">​Civil Service statistics: 2019​</a>’ reported that the Civil Service headcount for 2019 was 445,480. Below are the statistics based on sexual orientation<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reporting rates for sexual orientation have increased from 38.1% in 2015 when it was first collected, to 57.2% in 2019.</li>
    <li>Of which, 4.9% identify as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or recorded their sexual orientation as ‘other’ (LGBO) in 2019, up from 4.6% in 2018.</li>
    <li>This has increased every year since data on sexual orientation has been captured in these statistics, and is up 1.2 percentage points since 2015.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>According to Stonewall’s ‘LGBT in Britain - Work Report 2018’<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More than a third of LGBT staff (35per cent) have hidden that they are LGBT at work for fear of discrimination.</li>
    <li>One in eight lesbian, gay and bi people (12 per cent) wouldn’t feel confident reporting any homophobic or biphobic bullying to their employer.</li>
    <li>One in five trans people (21 per cent) wouldn’t report transphobic bullying in the workplace.</li>
    <li>Almost a third of non-binary people (31 per cent) and one in five trans people (18 per cent) don’t feel able to wear work attire representing their gender expression.</li>
    <li>Nearly two in five bi people (38 per cent) aren’t out to anyone at work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="what-can-allies-do">What can allies do?</h2>

  <h3 id="avoid-assumptions">Avoid assumptions</h3>
  <p>Avoid making assumptions about a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender.</p>

  <p>Avoid assuming a person’s pronouns - instead ask a colleague their pronouns and use the correct pronouns when referring to them.</p>

  <p>Avoid assumptions about a person’s relationships - using neutral language such as ‘they’ or ‘partner’ instead of ‘he/she’ or ‘boyfriend/girlfriend’ can be helpful.</p>

  <p>Don’t assume you know someone’s experiences and/or oppressions based on restrictive stereotypes.</p>

  <p>Even if you identify as LGBT+, don’t assume you know someone’s experiences and/or oppressions based on your own.</p>

  <p>Don’t assume that all LGBT+ people are out. Remember that people are at different points of coming out or transitioning - so respect people’s privacy.</p>

  <p>Be aware that a person’s sexuality, gender identity and gender expression may vary and not correspond.</p>

  <h3 id="educate-yourself">Educate yourself</h3>

  <p>Read stories online or in books to gain an understanding of LGBT+ history, legislation and people’s lived experiences of discrimination and equality.</p>

  <p>You can even educate yourself by watching films that detail LGBT+ history, legislation and people’s lived experiences of discrimination and equality.</p>

  <p>Allies should inform themselves and seek sources of information independently rather than assuming minority colleagues are there to inform them.</p>

  <p>Understand that different identities come with individual challenges.</p>

  <p>Learn the differences between lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans as well as queer, intersex, asexual and pansexual along with gender fluid and non-binary identities.</p>

  <p>Learn and avoid inappropriate questions and discriminative language.</p>

  <p>Understand and learn the difference between someone’s sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>

  <p>Recognise the importance of using people’s correct pronouns - ‘she/her’, ‘he/him’ and ‘they/them’.</p>

  <p>Understand that everyone has different experiences that come with different advantages and disadvantages.</p>

  <p>Learn about intersectionality, whereby people face dual discrimination and inequality because of more than one factor, such as: sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender re-assignment, race, class disability, or religion &amp; beliefs.</p>

  <h3 id="understand-your-privilege">Understand your privilege</h3>

  <p>Understand and recognise what privileges you hold as heterosexual and/or cisgender person that an LGBT+ person might not (considering intersectionality).</p>

  <p>Understand and recognise that you can never know how someone elses discrimination and inequality feels, but you can use your voice to raise awareness of LGBT+ issues.</p>

  <p>Understand your own unconscious bias.</p>

  <p>Do not deny people’s experiences or feelings just because they are not things you have experienced or felt.</p>

  <p>Be mindful that not all LGBT+ people have the freedom to be out due to certain circumstances.
Even if you are out and proud, remember that others may not be free to do the same.</p>

  <h3 id="listen">Listen</h3>
  <p>Consider your own behaviour; ask for feedback, reflect, adapt and learn how to behave in ways that invite people in, instead of pushing them away.</p>

  <p>Listen with an open mind and don’t restrict people’s experiences to stereotypes to help create an inclusive and safe space for LGBT+ people.</p>

  <p>Be okay with not always being part of the conversation, as well as being prepared to be 
there for the good times ​and​ the bad.</p>

  <p>Listen​ then respond to LGBT+ people’s requests.</p>

  <p>Don’t assume you have enough knowledge or understanding to speak for​ the community. Listen, learn and speak to LGBT+ people to find out what changes they want, ​then​ act.</p>

  <h3 id="take-action">Take action</h3>
  <p>Make space so that the quiet/unnoticed/missing voices can be heard.</p>

  <p>Sign petitions to help demand LGBT+ inclusion and change.</p>

  <p>Support LGBT+ events (e.g. Pride) by attending, volunteering, raising money or helping advertise (e.g. sharing posts online).</p>

  <h3 id="speak-up">Speak up</h3>
  <p>Be a voice for the LGBT+ community when they aren’t in the room, including being prepared to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.</p>

  <p>Challenge constructively when you see something going wrong – an inappropriate comment or an interaction that is failing to build relationships.</p>

  <p>Follow the appropriate bullying and harassment procedure if you become aware of homophobia, biphobia or transphobia.</p>

  <h3 id="act-at-work">Act at work</h3>
  <p>You can join and support your department’s LGBT+ Network and take-action in solidarity ​alongside​ your LGBT+ colleagues.</p>

  <p>You can be visible and encourage work to be a safe space by attending LGBT+ events, wearing a rainbow lanyard or putting posters up.</p>

  <p>Make a habit of introducing yourself with your pronouns, not just in LGBT+ specific situations.</p>

  <p>Use neutral language such as ‘they’ and ‘partner’ to avoid excluding people from the conversation.</p>

  <p>Add your pronouns to your email sign off or note that you are an ally/member of your LGBT+ Network to help make people feel comfortable.</p>

  <p>Highlight key LGBT+ dates in your department’s newsletters and other communications.</p>

  <p>Run events in your office to mark key LGBT+ dates or raise money for LGBT+ charities.</p>

  <p>If you set up an event, be mindful that people may not want an LGBT+ event in their calendar as they are not out at work. Therefore, set the calendar invite as private to prevent any risk and to help make LGBT+ people feel safe.</p>

  <p>If you email LGBT+ Network members, be mindful that people may not want others to see their email address in a LGBT+ email as they are not out at work. Therefore, blind copy them in to prevent any risk and to help make LGBT+ people feel safe.</p>

  <p>Share and raise awareness of LGBT+ events in your office and department. You may make someone feel more comfortable at work, or you may encourage someone to attend who otherwise wouldn’t have.</p>

  <p>Encourage change if there aren’t LGBT+ policies or training in place to help raise awareness and tackle discrimination.</p>

  <p>Start a network if there isn’t one already.</p>

  <p>Encourage conversations about LGBT+ issues to promote inclusion in the office – there may be someone around you who isn’t out, and this could make them feel supported and comfortable at work.</p>
