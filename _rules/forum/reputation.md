## About this publication

## About the reputation system

Our forum uses a system of 'reputation' to ensure that our online community stays safe, and to guide you through your first few weeks and months of participating in the community. It helps us to keep conversation friendly and prevent SPAM.

We have 5 different reputation levels – from Magenta to Platinum.

## Magenta – for new users

By default, all new users start out with Magenta reputation, meaning they need to earn reputation as a trusted user.

As a Magenta user, you won't be able to do some things until you've learnt the community norms and the way our community works.

You won't be able to:

* send personal messages to other users
* use the “reply as new topic” function
* flag posts
* post more than 1 image
* post any attachments
* post more than 2 hyperlinks in a post
* have links in the ‘about me’ field of their profile
* mention more than 2 users in a post
* post more than 3 topics
* post more than 10 replies
* edit their own posts after more than 24 hours

## Bronze – for novice users

You can be promoted to Bronze reputation by just reading things other people have posted on the community. You get trust Bronze reputation by:

* opening at least **3** topics
* reading at least **10** posts
* spending a total of **5** minutes reading posts

Once you've got Bronze reputation, you can:

* use all the core functions of the website; all new user restrictions are removed
* send private messages
* upload images and attachments
* edit wiki posts
* flag posts
* mute other users

## Silver – for regular users

If you keep participating in the community, you can earn Silver reputation. Get to Silver reputation by:

* visiting at least **5** days, not sequentially
* casting at least **1** like
* receiving at least **1** like
* replying to at least **3** different topics
* entering at least **10** topics
* reading at least **30** posts
* spending a total of **30** minutes reading posts

Once you have Silver reputation, you can:

* use the “Invite others to this topic” button to invite brand new users to participate in topics
* invite outside users to private messages making a group private message
* like and edit posts more often
* add users to a personal ignore list
* edit your posts for up to 30 days after posting

## Gold – for frequent users

If you get to Gold reputation, you're showing you're the most active readers and reliable contributors to our community. To get Gold reputation, in the last 100 days:

* you must have visited the forum on **25** separate days
* you have replied to at least **10** different topics
* of the topics created in the last 100 days, must have viewed **10%** of them
* of the posts created in the last 100 days, must have read **5%** of them
* you must have received **10** likes, and given **20** likes.*
* you must not have received more than 5 spam or offensive flags
* must not have been suspended or silenced in the last 6 months

Gold reputation isn't permanent – use it or you lose it! The system checks these stats every 100 days. All of the above criteria must be true to achieve Gold reputation.

Once you have Gold reputation, you can:

* access "The Village" – an exclusive category just for Gold reputation users and above
* recategorise and rename topics
* hide SPAM posts from Magenta reputation users for everyone else
* like and edit posts more often

## Platinum – for community leaders

Users with Platinum reputation are our most trusted users. They set a positive example for the community through their actions and their posts. If you need advice, these are the folks you turn to first, and they’ve earned the highest level of community trust, such that they are almost moderators within the community already.

Very few users get to Platinum reputation – they are granted this status by administrators and moderators.

Users with Platinum reputation can:

* edit all posts
* pin/unpin topic
* close topics
* archive topics
* make topics unlisted
* split and merge topics
* reset topic bump date
* like and edit posts more often

## Moderators and admins

We also have a series of users who act as moderators and administrators for the forum; they tend to be people directly involved in running the Network.
