Marked on 23 September each year since 1999, Bi Visibility Day raises bi awareness and challenges bisexual & biromantic erasure.

#### What is BiSpace?
BiSpace is a social initiative run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. This is facilitated by the Bi+ Inclusion Team under the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.
The term 'bi+' encompasses bisexual, asexual, pansexual, queer and other similar identities.
