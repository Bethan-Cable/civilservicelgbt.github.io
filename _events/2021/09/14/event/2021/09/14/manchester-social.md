We look forward to welcoming all colleagues to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network social in Manchester. Manchester is the first to return for the North West but Liverpool will be back soon. 

Look out for Ross and an inflatable animal that's easy to spot, or contact us on northwest@civilservice.lgbt and we will share phone numbers or arrange to meet you if you do not want to come alone or unsure where to go.

Pop in after work. We are normally there until 21:00. Please drop in and say hi or stay a while if you can.
