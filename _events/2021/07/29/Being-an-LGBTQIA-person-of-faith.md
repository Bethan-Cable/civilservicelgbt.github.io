Whenever religion and LGBT+ issues are part of the same discussion, the focus is usually on the harm that has been done by religious people and institutions on the LGBT+ community, or traditional religious beliefs and teachings about sexuality and gender. 

There is less discussion around what it is like to be an LGBT+ person of faith and the different positive and negative experiences that those people face. Some may be part of a community that fully embraces and celebrates their lives, some may be part of a faith tradition that doesn’t necessarily accept all of who they are, and some may experience rejection from other LGBT+ people because of their faith.

This panel event will explore the lived experiences of different LGBT+ people of faith – the conflict, the support, the struggles, and reflections about the intersections of faith, and sexuality and gender identity. 

Following a discussion between panel members, attendees will be invited to ask questions and share reflections in an open and safe space.
