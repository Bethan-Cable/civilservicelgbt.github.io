Our in-person socials are back, starting in London. 

Join us and meet other LGBT+ civil servants for a sensibly socially-distanced catch up to celebrate Pride and PrideON 2021.

We will meet near the Guards Memorial and try to find a spot.

Please bring your own refreshments.

**Update:** This event's date has been changed to take account of changes to the easing of Covid-19 related restrictions in England.
