We are excited to invite you to a panel event where we will discuss the intersectionality experienced by people who are disabled and LGBTQ+.

We would encourage you to reflect before the event on several topics in order to help shape our discussions:

How can disability shape LGBTQ+ expression?

How can pride in our LGBTQ+ identities differ from pride in our identities as disabled people?

What would you like to see change to increase equality in intersectional spaces?

For the avoidance of doubt, 'disabled' and 'disability' are meant in their widest sense and we welcome a broad spectrum of experiences within this.

The discussion will be informally chaired and there will be a window for questions from the audience at the end. The event will not be recorded in order to facilitate open conversation. However, a summary blog will be put up shortly after the event. Our panellists are from different departments across the Civil Service and this event will be open across Government.
