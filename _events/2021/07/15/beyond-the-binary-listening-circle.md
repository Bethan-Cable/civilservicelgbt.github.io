As part of [BiSpace](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/bispace/), the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a:gender are hosting a listening circle to provide a safe space for bi+ and ace+ colleagues to discuss experiences outside the binary. 

Listening circles allow under-represented groups to come together and discuss thoughts and concerns in a supportive environment. 

"Beyond the Binary" is a chance for you to share or just listen to colleagues sharing their identity journeys and lived experiences beyond sexuality, romantic and gender binaries.

Joining details will be circulated on the day of the event. If you have any questions please contact Alan.Edwards@dhsc.gov.uk.
