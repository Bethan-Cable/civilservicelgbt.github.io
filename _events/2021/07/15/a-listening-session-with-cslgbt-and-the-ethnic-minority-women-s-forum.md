The Ethnic Minority Women's Forum (EMWF) are hosting a listening session in partnership with CS LGBT+ Network, aimed at Civil Servants who identify as ethnic minorities, and are part of the LGBT+ community or have LGBT+ family and friends. The listening session will take place on Thursday 15 July at 12pm.

It will be a safe space to share thoughts, experiences and reflections following Pride month, and an opportunity to tell EMWF how we can best support our LGBT+ members.

There will be no requirement to speak or even turn on your camera - feel free to join just to listen!

The session will not be recorded or minuted, and nothing said in the session will be shared outside of it.'
