AceSpace is a social event for civil servants on the ace spectrum, including asexual, grey-asexual, demisexual and aromantic people. This is often an underrepresented group within the LGBT+ community with few visible role models, so this event was created to give aces a space to meet and chat.

The event will be hosted over Teams. Please sign up using your government email address. If you have any questions about the event please contact Alan.Edwards@dhsc.gov.uk.

#### This session is for Civil Servants only.

A friendly reminder to please only register for this event using your work email. In most instances this should end in GOV.UK. We are aware that some areas of the Civil Service do not use GOV.UK emails, if this is the case, please let us know when registering.

If you use a personal email and we can not verify you are a civil servant, you will not be sent joining instructions to the event. If your work device does not support the systems we are using, we suggest forwarding the details to your personal device or using the dial in options.

> Is your department or network hosting a digital event? Let us know and we can share it on our website.
