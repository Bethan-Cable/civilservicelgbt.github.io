Discussions around allyship often focus on the wider LGBT+ community, with the needs and problems faced by bi+ people sometimes overlooked. Our panel discussion will explore how allies from both within and outside the LGBT+ community have supported bi+ people, and where there is room to do more.

The event will be held with a panel discussion, followed by participants being split into virtual breakout rooms to discuss what bi+ allyship means to them (there is no obligation to for anyone to speak or switch their video on if they do not wish to), with the panel closing the event.

The event will be hosted on Zoom. If you have any questions please contact Alan.Edwards@dhsc.gov.uk.
