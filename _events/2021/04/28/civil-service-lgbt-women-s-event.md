We would like to invite LGBT+ women from across the Civil Service to join us Wednesday 28th April from 12.30 – 13.30 for a chance to have an informal lunch time (virtual) social. Feel free to bring along food or a cup of coffee if you wish.

We would like to hear your thoughts and ideas on what more the Civil Service LGBT+ Network can do to support LGBT+ women and what type of events you would like to see from us in the future.

If you can’t attend but would like to contribute some suggestions then please do drop us an email.

### This session is for Civil Servants only.

A friendly reminder to please only register for this event using your work email. In most instances this should end in GOV.UK. We are aware that some areas of the Civil Service do not use GOV.UK emails, if this is the case, please let us know when registering.

If you use a personal email and we can not verify you are a civil servant, you will not be sent joining instructions to the event. If your work device does not support the systems we are using, we suggest forwarding the details to your personal device or using the dial in options.
