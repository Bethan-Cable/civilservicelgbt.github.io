a:gender and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be holding a session in which we will remember people that have had their lives taken as a result of transphobic violence in the last year.

Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) happens every year on 20th November. As this lands on a Saturday, we are holding a remembrance session on Friday 19th to mark TDoR.

We will have a quiet vigil where we will introduce what TDoR is for those who do not know, read out the names of the people that have lost their lives because of transphobic violence and hold a minute of silent reflection. This event will be held over Microsoft Teams.

**Please register with your workplace email address.** Eligible attendees will be sent a link to the event after 16:00 on 18 November 2021.

Please contact the a:gender inbox if you would like to request the event password or if you have any questions: <agender@homeoffice.gov.uk>.
