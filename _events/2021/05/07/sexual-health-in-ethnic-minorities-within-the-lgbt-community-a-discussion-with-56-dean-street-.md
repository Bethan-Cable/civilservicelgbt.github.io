The Civil Service Race Forum (CSRF) is excited to be collaborating with 56 Dean Street to bring you this event exploring PrEP, HIV, sexual health services, and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sexual health.

This event will focus specifically on data and services relating to ethnic minorities within the LGBT+ community.

Our guest speaker – a professional sexual health expert from 56 Dean Street - will deliver a short presentation on these issues. Attendees will then be given time to ask questions in a safe, judgement-free environment. To ensure attendees feel comfortable we will use Slido to facilitate anonymous questions and we will not record the Q&A part of the event.

For more information about services offered by 56 Dean Street please visit their site here.

There are limited places at this event so please sign up using the Eventbrite link below. We look forward to seeing you there!
