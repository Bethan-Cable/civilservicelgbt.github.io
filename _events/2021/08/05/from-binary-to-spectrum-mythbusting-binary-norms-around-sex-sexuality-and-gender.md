> This is a repeated session of an earlier event. If you have already attended the first session, please do not register for this one.

A binary approach to sex, sexuality, and gender has shaped traditional Western thought. This male/female, masculine/feminine, homosexual/heterosexual binary mindset has influenced Western traditions, values, and behaviours for centuries. Through empire and globalisation these norms have been exported and often forced on other cultures, influencing the global narrative around sex, sexuality, and gender.

This session will focus on unpicking the binary narrative around sex, sexuality, and gender, and offer an alternative perspective that is more informed and more inclusive.

A short presentation will explain some key terms including what we mean by 'binary norms', the origins and history of these norms, their impact (both on LGBTQI+ people and cultures upon which these views were forced), and conclude with a different way of viewing sex, sexuality, and gender.

Following the presentation there will be a facilitated discussion to explore reflections on these issues and personal stories, and give attendees the opportunity to ask questions in an open and safe space.
