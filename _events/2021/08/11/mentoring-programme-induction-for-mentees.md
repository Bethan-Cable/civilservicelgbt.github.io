## About this event

The [Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme](/mentoring) provides LGBT+ people working in the Civil Service access to mentors who are also LGBT+ and working in more senior roles.

This event is for mentees – people who want some career support from a more senior civil servant.

During the event we will:

- explain how the programme is going to work in practice
- share tips for building your mentoring relationship with your mentor
- provide a chance for you to ask any questions you might have

Prior to the event, we recommend that you read the guidance we have published on our website.

## How to register

This is one of three, optional inductions events being held for mentors that have joined the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme. **All three events will have identical content: you only need to register once.**

Separate induction events will be held for those who have registered as mentors.

You should register using the same email address that you used to register for the scheme – which should have been your Civil Service email address.

## How to join the event

The event will take place over Google Meet. If you cannot access Google Meet on your work device, you can forward your ticket to a personal device and access it that way.

The Google Meet details for this event will be available 1 hour prior to the event to those who register.
