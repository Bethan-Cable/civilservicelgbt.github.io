This is the inaugural Civil Service LGBT+ Network and DWPride social event for 2021. 

We will be meeting at Caversham Bridge and walking the 7 miles to Pangbourne. Depending on numbers we will find a caf√© in Pangbourne and get the train back to Reading.

This is a fun casual event, we will be walking at a moderate pace (we are not the ramblers)and the walk should take about 3.5 - 4 hours.

Please bring your own water and snacks, wear appropriate foot wear for a river-side walk in summer (trainers) and sun hat. There is no cost other than the train fare. 
 
This event will be restricted 20 participants. Please email to book your place. It will be on a first-come first-serve basis.

On the day, I will be wearing a purple top and base ball cap with a small rainbow flag flying from my ruck sack.
