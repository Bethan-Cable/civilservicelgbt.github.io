Join our regular, in-person social and networking event for LGBT+ civil servants. 

This event will be held at 'Via' in Manchester, organised by our local volunteer, Ross Starkie.

The Civil Service LGBT+ group will be identifiable by an inflatable unicorn at the venue.

Ross said:

> It was great to see some of the usual attendees and some great new people at the social last month. I know I loved getting back out and spending time with our network members. 
I look forward to seeing lots of people again at this month's event.
