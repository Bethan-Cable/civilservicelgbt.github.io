Join us for an informal and friendly social get-together with a quiz for those who would like to take part. Bring along drinks & snacks, relax & enjoy!

AceSpace is a social event for civil servants on the ace and aro spectrums, including asexual, grey-asexual, demisexual and aromantic people. This is often an underrepresented group within the LGBT+ community with few visible role models, so this event was created to give aces and aros a space to meet and chat.

The virtual event will be hosted over Microsoft Teams. Please sign up using your Government email address.

If you have any questions about the event please contact [Robin.Tamblyn@rpa.gov.uk](mailto:Robin.Tamblyn@rpa.gov.uk) or [Justin.Pugh@dhsc.gov.uk](mailto:Justin.Pugh@dhsc.gov.uk)
