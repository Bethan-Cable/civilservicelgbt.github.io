**We're back with our regular in person London socials happening on the first Thursday of every month.**

We ran an event at the end of July in St James Park and it was clear from the feedback we received that network members were keen for more socials to be organised when it was safe to do so. These events are designed to be inclusive, fun and relaxed providing LGBT+ Civil Servants with an opportunity to meet others and make new friends.

Whether this is your first time attending or if you have been a regular in the past it would be great to see you as we restart our monthly social events (occurring on the first Thursday of each month).

Our October social will be held at the upstairs bar in Comptons on Old Compton Street, Soho.

If you have any questions please contact <london@civilservice.lgbt>.
