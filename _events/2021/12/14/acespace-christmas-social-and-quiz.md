This event is intended as an informal and friendly space for people from the Ace and Aro community to get together to have some fun and fellowship and to share experiences.

Please come along and have a chat. Bring your drinks and snacks and feel free to bring alcohol as well. The event will take place after standard office hours so that should be OK, not that I am advocating drunk and disorderly behaviour!

There will be a seasonal general knowledge quiz and I will sing excerpts from Christmas songs, traditional and modern so you have to guess the name of the song and the artiste where applicable. There will probably be a couple of non-Christmas rounds too !

Although primarily aimed at members of the Ace and Aro community across the Civil Service, all are welcome !

I shall look forward to seeing you.

Compliments of the Season to you.

Justin Pugh.
