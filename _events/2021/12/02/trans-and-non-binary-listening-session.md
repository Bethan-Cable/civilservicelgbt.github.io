We want the Civil Service to be the best employer for LGBT+ people; and we want the **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** to be an inclusive place for trans and non-binary civil servants. Working with [a:gender](https://www.agender.org.uk), we are holding a series of listening sessions in December 2021 to help us achieve that. 

These sessions will explore:

- awareness of the different types of events and activities we run
- whether people feel included in our events
- what more we could do to support trans and non-binary people

We will be holding 3 events: 1 in person and 2 online. You can [find the other dates on our events page](/events).

The events will be led by the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's vice chair for trans and non-binary inclusion, [Alan Edwards](/team/alan-edwards).
