We will be holding our first in person BiSpace social for over 18 months on Wednesday 8 December. BiSpace is for civil servants who are bi+ (including bisexual, pansexual, queer or other minority sexual orientations) or on the asexual or aromantic spectrums. It is organised by bi+ civil servants. 

This will be an opportunity to meet and socialise with other bi+ and ace civil servants.

We will be holding in person events like this periodically throughout the coming year and will continue holding virtual events as we have been over the past two years.
