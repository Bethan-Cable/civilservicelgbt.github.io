Do you fall under the bi+ or ace spectrums and sometimes feel excluded from Pride?

Pride is supposed to include the whole LGBTQIA+ community. This can be threatened by behaviours like transphobia and the erasure of some sexualities. Many bi+ (bisexual, pansexual, queer, etc.), ace (asexual, demisexual, grey-asexual) and aromantic people feel that they do not belong or are not welcome at Pride. This can take the form of language that is not inclusive such as "Gay Pride", assuming that bi+ people in different gender relationships are straight, or erroneously saying that the A in the LGBTQIA+ acronym refers to "allies" rather than asexual/aromantic/agender, as well as outright biphobia and acephobia in some cases.

We will hold an open discussion on how to address these issues and ensure that bi+, ace and aromantic people feel included and welcome at Pride.

This event is open to all civil servants, however you identify, but the focus will be on bi+ and ace experiences. Participants are welcome to attend and just listen to the discussion, or to only participate in the discussion using the chat function.
