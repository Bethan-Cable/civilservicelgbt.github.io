Mason Funk is an award-winning writer/producer and launched OUTWORDS to capture stories for LGBT+ pioneers and elders. 
 
Mason was born in Los Angeles in 1958, graduated from Stanford University, and lived in Tacoma, Washington, Portland, Maine and Lisbon, Portugal before returning to Los Angeles and beginning his career as an award-winning writer/producer of non-fiction television programs and documentary films. 

His TV and film projects have covered topics ranging from Mother Teresa to the history of secret White House recordings to the long-term effects of concussions in professional football to an American teenager's quest to keep her undocumented Guatemalan mother from being deported. He has received two Emmy nominations for his work in television.

In 2016, Mason launched OUTWORDS to capture the timeless, inspiring stories of LGBTQ pioneers and elders. An avid distance runner, choral singer and chef, Mason lives with his husband Jay Edwards and their French bulldog Henri in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.
