This Pride Month, the Ethnic Minority Women's Forum is thrilled to partner with a:gender and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network to bring you an allyship teach-in!

The ethnic minority and LGBT+ communities share a lot of intersections, and we have a lot to learn from each other. We all face multiple micro-aggressions daily. But do we truly stand up for those other marginalised groups which we may not be a part of?

This event will challenge what you think you know about being an ally, to allow you to become a better one.

This event will be open to all an weâ€™ll send all attendees an allyship toolkit to support you in developing the reflection and practices needed to really foster an inclusive environment at work.

So make sure you're up for practising what you preach and join this amazing teach-in!
