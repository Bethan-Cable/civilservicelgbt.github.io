Join staff from across the Civil Service as they discuss some of their favourite books with LGBT+ themes. If we miss out _your_ favourite, don't worry - we'll also be opening up the call for attendees to share their own favourite choices.

Whether you enjoy fiction or non-fiction of any genre and medium - from graphic novels to brick-size works of literary fiction - come along to discuss your reading loves and hopefully be introduced to something new.

And books are for life, not just for Pride Season -- so following the call, there will also be the chance to sign up for a regularly-scheduled book club.
