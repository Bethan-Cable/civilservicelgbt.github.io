> Hosted by the HMRC LGBT+ Network, PRISM.

Join the HMRC LGBT+ Network as they hear from the Naz and Matt Foundation as part of their pride season of events.

The Naz and Matt Foundation tackle homophobia triggered by religion to help parents accept their children. Their mission is to never let religion, any religion, come in the way of the unconditional love between parents and their children.

Naz and Matt Foundation was set up in 2014 following the sad loss of Matt’s fiancé, Naz, who took his own life two days after his deeply religious family confronted him about his sexuality.

Naz and Matt Foundation exists to empower and support LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, and Intersex) individuals, their friends and family to work towards resolving challenges linked to sexuality or gender identity, particularly where religion is heavily influencing the situation.

They are a registered UK charity and have won multiple awards for our work building bridges between religious and LGBTQI+ communities.
