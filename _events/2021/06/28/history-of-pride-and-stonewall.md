Whilst we celebrate the Pride in June each year, we want to commemorate the struggles and lives of those who fought for these sparked the global movement.

28 June marks the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, a civil rights movement that marked the beginning of the journey towards equality for the LGBT+ community.

On this day, we want members to take a trip back in time and learn about the history of the riots. In collaboration with the Ethnic Minority Womens Forum, we want to explore the intersectionality of the movement and how this impacts that intersect of race, gender, and sexuality even today.

We will be hosting a 30 minute lunch and learn event on Teams for members of CSLGBT+ and EMWF to come and join us to celebrate the event that started it all.
