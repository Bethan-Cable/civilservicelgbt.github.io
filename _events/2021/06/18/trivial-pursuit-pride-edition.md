Do you know your Ian McKellens from your Edna Everages? Can you tell Pride Cymru from Pride Cape Town?

Then come and play Trivial Pursuit - Pride Edition!

Hosted as part of the Civil Service PrideON series, this is a fun after-work quiz based on the popular family board game.

We'll be starting at 16:00 on Friday 18 June, and finish... whenever someone wins (hopefully!).

Come along, have a chat with your fellow civil servants, and find out just how good your LGBTQ+ general knowledge really is!


(Other trivia games are available.)
