        &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network has run social and networking events across the UK for more than a decade. Since lockdown restrictions eased last year, we’ve rebooted them in our usual locations. Now we’re adding even more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-the-locations&quot;&gt;All the locations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, you’ll now be able to attend socials in all of these locations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birmingham&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bristol&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glasgow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liverpool&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manchester&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Southampton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these socials are led by our ‘local organiser’ team.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Marc and I lead on Pride for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hybrid-pride-for-2022&quot;&gt;A hybrid Pride for 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic struck in 2020, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network took pride online and led the Civil Service’s first ever, all digital pride season with hundreds of civil servants taking part. Pride is an important part of the LGBT+ calendar and this year we want to come back bigger, prouder and better than ever. That’s why this year, we’re planning a hybrid Pride; with an online programme taking place alongside physical participation across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is a special occasion for the LGBT+ community where we are able to remember our history, raise awareness of the issues LGBT+ people face, and campaign for equality no matter your sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. It’s a time where we’re able to embrace and shout about our identities with our families, friends and allies and make our voices heard from the past and for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;express-your-interest-for-in-person-events&quot;&gt;Express your interest for in-person events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently still scoping out what locations we are able to attend in person for Pride 2022. To help us decide which locations are the best for us to attend, please complete our &lt;a href=&quot;/consultation/pride-2022-expression-of-interest&quot;&gt;expression of interest form&lt;/a&gt; and let us know where you’d most like to take part. Please complete the form by 16 February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/consultation/pride-2022-expression-of-interest&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Register your interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-us-put-pride-on-again&quot;&gt;Help us put Pride On again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming to continue our digital programme alongside in person events for Pride 2022 so as many colleagues as possible can participate. We need your help to do that. It could be a small contribution like writing a blog post for our website, or a bigger contribution like helping to organise an online social or panel event. If you’d like to help us create this online programme, please email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confirming-our-plans&quot;&gt;Confirming our plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further details, including where we decide to attend pride events in person, will be published in March. Where attendance is restricted due to ticket capacity – for example, at events in London or Manchester – tickets will be allocated on a lottery basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-up-to-date&quot;&gt;Keep up to date&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;/pride-2022&quot;&gt;Pride topic page&lt;/a&gt; on our website. We’ll be adding all the details of our upcoming events and activities when we know them. You can also sign up to &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us&quot;&gt;get email alerts&lt;/a&gt; to keep up to date with the latest news from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t wait for Pride this year and look forward to hearing from you. Get in contact with &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt; if you’re keen to play a big part in this year’s Pride for the Network.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Dee and I lead on career development for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, supported by &lt;a href=&quot;/team/tom-seddon&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;. We’re excited to tell you about our plans to make the career development offer for LGBT+ staff the best in the Civil Service and more importantly, how you can get involved and help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone currently working in HR, I understand the importance of inclusion and enabling people to bring their whole selves to work. The Civil Service seeks to represent the society it serves and it’s important to have LGBT+ staff visible across all levels of the organisation. Research conducted by our predecessor network; the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance, found that many of you felt like you didn’t have access to the same career development opportunities as your straight, cis-gendered counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this research, we launched our mentoring programme which was designed and delivered by our current chair &lt;a href=&quot;/team/john-peart&quot;&gt;John Peart&lt;/a&gt;. Since it’s launch more than 850 mentors and mentees have registered to take part, over 500 people have been given training and over 1000 mentoring matches have been facilitated. We’ve also picked up a &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/12/16/weve-won-a-civil-service-award&quot;&gt;Civil Service Award&lt;/a&gt; which recognises the amazing efforts and time dedicated by all those involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look to 2022, we want to build and expand on this success so that all LGBT+ civil servants, no matter their career aspirations, have opportunities to thrive and become the best version of themselves within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three priorities for the next 12 months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliver the next iteration of the mentoring programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support the delivery of the LGBT+ Network conference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a wider career development programme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deliver-the-next-iteration-of-the-mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;Deliver the next iteration of the mentoring programme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled that our mentoring programme has helped so many of you and are proud of what we’ve delivered this year. We want to build on our success and work with you to deliver the next iteration of the programme. We will listen to what you have told us about the 2021 programme, what has and hasn’t worked and what we can do to improve it. We’ll refresh the supporting materials based on industry standards and your recommendations. And we’ll aim to re-launch the 2022 programme in April this year, keeping you informed each step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-the-delivery-of-the-lgbt-summer-conference&quot;&gt;Support the delivery of the LGBT+ Summer Conference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited for the LGBT+ Network’s conference which is currently planned to take place both virtually and in person. We’ll work with the conference team to design and deliver a fantastic programme which makes best use of our hybrid approach, delivers interesting sessions, and provides access to relevant resources, both during and afterwards. After all, who doesn’t love a good conference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-wider-career-development-programme&quot;&gt;Create a wider career development programme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we’ve got some exciting projects lined up for this year, we don’t want to lose sight of our overall ambition to make our career development offer the best in the Civil Service. We recognise this is the start of our journey and we want to look towards the future to identify relevant opportunities to expand on our offer based on your feedback. We want to engage with Civil Service HR to leverage access to existing data, information and resources. We want to better understand your career development needs and aspirations and we will feed this research into the design and launch of a bespoke programme in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what next? Well, we need you to make it all happen! We need you to engage with us, respond to us and support us in realising our ambitions. We are looking for passionate, motivated and committed people to turn our vision into reality. So whether you currently work in HR or fancy an opportunity to develop and flex new skills, whatever your career background, we’d love you to join us in making a positive difference to the careers of 1000s of LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get involved, you can email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dee@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;dee@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I hope it’s not too late to say: happy new year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; has continued to deliver an incredible amount of activity over the past 12 months. We have even bigger plans for 2022. The new year felt like a good opportunity to reflect on that and provide you with some updates on plans for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-achieved-in-2021&quot;&gt;What we achieved in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did lots of work and supported civil servants all over the country, but some of the highlights for me included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an award winning mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;. We launched the Civil Service’s first &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring programme for LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/a&gt; last year. More than 850 people have taken part across 80 departments and agencies. Last month, the programme won &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/12/16/weve-won-a-civil-service-award&quot;&gt;the Developing and Supporting Award at the Civil Service Awards 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;celebrating important dates&lt;/strong&gt;. We celebrated and marked important dates in the LGBT+ calendar throughout the year, including LGBT History Month, &lt;a href=&quot;/topic/lesbian-visibility-week&quot;&gt;Lesbian Visibility Week&lt;/a&gt;, Transgender Day of Remembrance and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keeping PrideON, again&lt;/strong&gt;. Our virtual Pride programme – PrideON – returned for a second year with a range of online events taking place throughout the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;restarting our socials&lt;/strong&gt;. Our in-person social events started to return in the latter part of the year. We held successful social and networking events in Bristol, Liverpool, London and Manchester.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;building on BiSpace&lt;/strong&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&quot;/topic/bispace&quot;&gt;BiSpace&lt;/a&gt; programme continued to develop and provide a space for bi+ civil servants, by bi+ civil servants. A new &lt;a href=&quot;/topic/acespace&quot;&gt;AceSpace&lt;/a&gt; also started to take shape, led by civil servants on the asexual and aromantic spectrum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our network only achieves this because of people stepping up and taking ownership to deliver everything you see us do. None of this would have been possible without our &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;volunteer team&lt;/a&gt;; so thank you to all of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-will-do-next&quot;&gt;What we will do next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we hope to achieve even more. In November, we published a forward plan of &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan&quot;&gt;our work and programmes&lt;/a&gt;. We think it’s an ambitious but realistic plan, and we have lots of new team members giving up their time to help us to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to draw attention to a few of the milestones coming up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-civil-service-pride&quot;&gt;1. Civil Service Pride&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have started to plan a hybrid Pride programme for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Pride events resume in their traditional fashion this year, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network intends to join marches and parades across the UK. Alongside that, we will be continuing to host a slightly smaller programme of online events and activities, so that no matter where you live you have something you can get involved with during Pride season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Vice-Chair for Pride, &lt;a href=&quot;/team/marc-fitchett&quot;&gt;Marc Fitchett&lt;/a&gt;, will be leading this work alongside our local organisers and other volunteers. If you want to get involved in organising the in-person or digital programme, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be discussing initial plans at our &lt;a href=&quot;/event/2022/01/19/leaders-of-networks-forum&quot;&gt;Leaders of Networks Forum event later this month&lt;/a&gt;, which is open to chairs, vice-chairs and committee members of departmental networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-lgbt-conference&quot;&gt;2. LGBT+ Conference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/team/james-jefferson&quot;&gt;James Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; wrote in December about our plans to create a new &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/12/14/a-conference-for-lgbt-civil-servants&quot;&gt;annual conference focused on workplace inclusion and career development&lt;/a&gt;. Like our pride activity, we are aiming to make this a fully hybrid conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a lot of help to make this possible and James is putting a team together, so &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james.jefferson@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in touch with James&lt;/a&gt; if you want to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-mentoring&quot;&gt;3. Mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following last year’s mentoring programme success, we’re planning to run it again this year. Our ambition is to re-open the programme again in April 2022 – a little earlier than last year, to avoid the summer holidays. A small team led by our new Vice Chair for Career Development, &lt;a href=&quot;team/dee&quot;&gt;Dee&lt;/a&gt;, is currently being formed around this programme to take over from the work I did last year, so if you’d like to be involved with that, please &lt;a href=&quot;dee@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email Dee directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-expanding-our-local-presence&quot;&gt;4. Expanding our local presence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of our Vice-Chairs, &lt;a href=&quot;/team/ed&quot;&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;, wrote last month that our local organisers help us to have &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/11/24/local-presence-national-influence&quot;&gt;a local presence and a national influence&lt;/a&gt;. We’re looking to double up on volunteers in each region and nation this year, so that we can deliver social and networking opportunities, learning and development opportunities and pride activities in every part of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team is already growing. If you want to join them, &lt;a href=&quot;ed@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;please email Ed directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-more-space-for-spaces&quot;&gt;5. More space for Spaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to highlight the development of new ‘Spaces’ to join BiSpace and AceSpace this year. Our current programmes have made our network a broader and more inclusive tent, and I hope that the work we will be doing to create similar space for trans and non-binary people (led by &lt;a href=&quot;/team/alan-edwards&quot;&gt;Alan Edwards&lt;/a&gt;), women, people with minority ethnicities, and allies (led by &lt;a href=&quot;/team/leah-cunnah&quot;&gt;Leah Cunnah&lt;/a&gt;) will expand that great work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact the lead vice chair if you’d like to involve yourself with those programmes of activity. We’re looking for someone to lead our women’s inclusion work in particular at the moment – if you think that should be you, &lt;a href=&quot;john.peart@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really excited about all of these things, and the rest of the activity we hope to achieve in our business plan. We can achieve more when everyone pitches in; so if you have the energy and capacity to help, please do contact the relevant lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, have a great start to 2022 and I hope to see you (in person or virtually) at our events throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme – our new career development offer for LGBT+ civil servants – has won the Developing and Supporting People Award at the 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilserviceawards.com/winners&quot;&gt;Civil Service Awards&lt;/a&gt;. The Developing and Supporting People Award recognises excellence across learning, skills development, strengthening capability, and talent management, or highly effective contributions to promoting or improving health and wellbeing within the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on the mentoring programme started earlier this year. Since then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than 425 mentors and 550 mentees have registered to take part&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than 500 people have been given training as part of the programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than 1,150 mentoring matches have been facilitated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We estimate that the programme generated more than 600 hours of speed mentoring in its first two months. By mid-2022, it will have generated more than 3,000 hours of mentoring opportunities for LGBT+ civil servants. We believe it is one of the largest mentoring programmes of its kind in the Civil Service, and has been developed entirely on a voluntary basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme was designed and delivered by &lt;a href=&quot;/team/john-peart&quot;&gt;John Peart&lt;/a&gt;, the new Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Commenting on the award, he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am absolutely thrilled that the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme has won this award. It is a recognition of the hundreds of LGBT+ civil servants who have selflessly given up their time to support and develop other LGBT+ civil servants, and help give their careers a boost. Thank you to everyone who stepped forward and offered their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme will be back in 2022. We will post more information about the programme on our website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/mentoring&quot;&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt/mentoring&lt;/a&gt; when it restarts. In the meantime, if you’d like to help us to run next year’s programme, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;mentoring@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As a community of LGBT+ civil servants, we work better together, we learn from one another and most all, we support each other to be our most inclusive selves. That’s why we’re holding an annual conference for LGBT+ civil servants focused on workplace inclusion and career development, starting in 2022. I’ll be leading a &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;team of volunteers&lt;/a&gt; to put together the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a conference for all LGBT+ civil servants and allies to come together to discuss, learn and collaborate. We want to provide you with opportunities to hear from others in our workplace on what they are doing to support workplace inclusion, to learn about strategies and initiatives your colleagues have implemented, and – most of all – to meet one another, whether that is digitally or in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference will give you access to LGBT+ civil servants of all grades from multiple departments, allowing for advice on career development, whether that is to achieve a promotion, learn about a different specialism or a change of career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also your conference. We want you to shape it to get what you want out of it – whether that’s a focus on a particular area; a discussion on something that matters most to you, or just being in a safe space with your peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-expect&quot;&gt;What can you expect?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing the conference now. Our aim is for the conference to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be available both digitally and in-person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have an agenda focusing on workplace inclusion and career development featuring speakers from across the Civil Service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be interactive with opportunity for granular discussion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be a safe space for discussion, learning and networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-need-your-help&quot;&gt;We need your help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to be leading this work stream and look forward to hearing from you what you want to get out of this conference. However, this is not a small task, so I am looking for a team of volunteers to ensure we can maximise the potential of what this conference can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need people with project delivery, communications, administrative or policy experience to make this a success. If you are interested please do get in touch with me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:james.jefferson@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;james.jefferson@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, we will consult with &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; members to hear your ideas on what you would like to gain from this conference. This will help us scope and set the right agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be stepping into the role of Vice Chair for Bi+ Inclusion and to lead our BiSpace programme, and grateful for the opportunity to lead a fantastic team. I have been a member of the BiSpace team for several years, and am looking forward to working closely with them, with John our Network Chair, and with the other Vice Chairs to deliver the Network’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-forward-plan-for-bispace&quot;&gt;A forward plan for BiSpace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently met with the BiSpace Team and we agreed our priorities for the coming year, with a focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;education, history and culture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;socials and networking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;combatting bullying, harassment and discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bispace-meet-ups&quot;&gt;BiSpace meet-ups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to return to in-person socials, but as ever we will have to keep a close eye on the ever evolving picture with regards to Covid and be mindful of current government guidance. The situation is changing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very grateful that I had the chance to meet a couple of others from the network “in real life” for a small but perfectly formed social in London earlier this week just before the work from home guidance resumed. We reflected on how lovely it is just to get the chance to be in the company of other bi+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of Covid developments we will continue to offer online opportunities for connection, as these can be inclusive for all sorts of reasons. As someone based in the far north I know I appreciate them, as it’s not always easy for me to get to major cities like London. Of course if there are local volunteers willing to lead socials in other cities that is certainly something we would be willing to embrace when the situation improves again, safety and current guidance permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved-with-bispace&quot;&gt;Get involved with BiSpace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of volunteers, a few of our team have had to move on recently so we are keen to recruit more. If you are interested in helping us to make the Civil Service a more welcoming and inclusive place for bi+ colleagues please do get in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sunny.thompson@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;sunny.thompson@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear your ideas and have more people to help us run projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited and honoured to remain as a Vice Chair for our Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Over the past 2.5 years, you may have worked with me in supporting our regional teams and tasks. I want to thank you for your continuous support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three programmes that I feel very passionate about and will be leading on are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Face-to-face socials and networking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting local delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volunteer deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, our regional teams (local organisers) are growing from strength to strength. We now have dedicated teams of volunteers covering Scotland, Wales and large parts of England, including London, South East, South West, North East and North West. Our local organisers coordinate between their local department networks, help organise socials and events close to you. They are a vital part of our network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an ambitious plan to expand our teams to cover all parts of the UK. If you are based in Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England or Northern Ireland and would like to support our network, we are very keen to speak to you. You can get in touch by emailing us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very grateful for our local organisers and volunteers. We are working closely with Civil Service HR teams and the Civil Service LGB&amp;amp;TI Champion and will ensure your hard work and contribution is recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So join us and be part for our exciting journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you would like to volunteer as a local organiser in your area, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As a network, we think allies are important. That’s why our &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; includes a commitment to develop a new Allies programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be leading work to create that programme and resources that allies across the Civil Service can use to champion LGBT+ inclusion in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-by-listening-to-you&quot;&gt;Starting by listening to you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find out what LGBT+ civil servants want cisgender and heterosexual civil servants to be more aware of and how they can be better allies. I also want to know how you think LGBT+ civil servants can be more supportive to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a first step in creating this programme, I plan to conduct a survey and series of workshops to hear your voices. After that, I will publish a report of the findings alongside a plan of how I and volunteers will work to deliver it. 
My hypothesis is that a series of resources like fact sheets or blog posts might be helpful; but we’ll be led by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing these resources, it would be great to have LGBT+ people involved. Where people feel comfortable in doing so, it would be great to hear and share your stories and experiences to help raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-building-an-allies-team&quot;&gt;We’re building an Allies team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t do this all by myself! We’re going to build a  team of volunteers, both LGBT+ and allies from an array of departments, to put this programme and resources together. Our goal as a team will be to increase awareness of LGBT+ issues and allyship that can be shared widely across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an LGBT+ ally myself, I am passionate about equality and diversity and want to improve other people’s knowledge and understanding to help raise awareness and challenge stereotypes. It would be great to have like-minded volunteers onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to just create resources for allies created by allies, I really want input from our LGBT+ members too. Whether that be filling out the survey, coming to a workshop, volunteering or simply sharing the resources. Everyone can help make sure that our new programme engages and activates our allies to help make the Civil Service a great place to work for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-in-touch&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want allies on board from across a variety of Departments so that resources can be shared in non-LGBT+ spaces to reach people who would not usually engage with resources on allyship. I’d also like to hear from allies and non-LGBT+ people what they would find useful to help educate and challenge them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get involved with this team, please email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:leah.cunnah@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;leah.cunnah@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;/team/alan-edwards&quot;&gt;Alan Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, my pronouns are they/he, and I’m the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s&lt;/strong&gt; new Vice Chair for trans and non-binary inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-space-for-trans-and-non-binary-members&quot;&gt;Creating space for trans and non-binary members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, I’ve helped to run our BiSpace programme for bi+ civil servants. It’s made a huge difference to how welcomed I feel as a bi+ person in this Network. I want that same sense of community to be available for trans and non-binary people in the Civil Service too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from what works with BiSpace, we want to make the Civil Service and the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; the best place to work as a trans or non-binary person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to hear from our members, and indeed any civil servant who is trans or non-binary, to help shape this work. We will be working closely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agender.org.uk/&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt; to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-our-listening-sessions&quot;&gt;Join our listening sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be holding three listening sessions over the next month for you to share your views with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics I would like to explore during these events will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;awareness of the different types of events and activities carried out by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether people feel included in the events organised by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is there anything not currently being done by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender that we ought to be doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events will take place on the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/12/02/trans-and-non-binary-listening-session-online-&quot;&gt;Thursday 2 December 2021, 17:00 to 18:00&lt;/a&gt; – Virtual&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/12/08/trans-and-non-binary-listening-session-in-person&quot;&gt;Wednesday 8 December 2021, 14:00 to 16:00&lt;/a&gt; – in person, London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/12/14/trans-and-non-binary-listening-session-online&quot;&gt;Tuesday 14 December 2021, 12:00 to 13:00&lt;/a&gt; – Virtual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual events will be very informal, so please feel free to join and leave at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the in-person event in London on 8 December you will need to be registered as a visitor to 100 Parliament Street and be escorted through the building if you do not have an existing building pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to make these events but would like to share your views please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alan.edwards@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the listening sessions I will draft a trans and non-binary inclusion plan in the new year, which will be published on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; is both a network of individual members and a network of networks. The structure of the Civil Service – which is made up for more than two dozen separate departments and more than 300 non-departmental bodies – means every organisation is different. They have different policies, procedures and culture. Having a local network is vital to ensure there is a constant link between LGBT+ staff on the ground and the management of every organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cross-government network, our role is to add unique value for local networks and ensure we don’t duplicate their efforts. Our ‘Leaders of Networks forum’ is one way we do that. It’s a regular chance for those running local departmental and agency networks to come together and discuss shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings have been on pause for a while during the pandemic; but I’m determined to restart them and ensure networks have that opportunity to collaborate and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-for-chairs-vice-chairs-or-committee-members&quot;&gt;It’s for chairs, vice chairs or committee members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks forum isn’t open to everyone; as the name implies, it’s for those who are involved with running and leading their local departmental or agency network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be the network chair who attends. You can send a vice-chair or other committee member if you like. You can send more than one person too, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-agenda-is-shaped-around-you&quot;&gt;The agenda is shaped around you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want these rebooted meetings to be laser-focused on issues or concerns networks are facing. Whilst we intend to have standing updates from the cross-government network team and from the Civil Service Inclusive Practice team, every meeting will also have plenty of time to focus on the things coming up across departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an agenda item you want to raise for our January meeting, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john.peart@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email me directly&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll see if I can squeeze it into the time available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dates-for-your-diary&quot;&gt;Dates for your diary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next Leaders of Networks forum will take place in January. We will then host the meetings on a quarterly basis from there on out: in April, July and October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dates and times for each meeting have already been scheduled, and you &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;find the full list on our events page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to register to attend each meeting, so make sure you complete the registration form. I hope to see lots of networks at our meeting in January.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme – an initiative developed by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; – has been shortlisted in this year’s Civil Service Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new cross-departmental scheme. Since work began in April 2021, 425 mentors and 550 mentees have registered, more than 500 people have been given training, and more than 1,150 mentoring matches have been facilitated by the programme. By mid-2022, it will have generated more than 3,000 hours of mentoring. It is one of the largest mentoring programmes of its kind in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mentoring programme has nominated in the Developing and Supporting People Award category. The Developing and Supporting People Award recognises projects and individuals that demonstrate excellence across learning, skills development, strengthening capability, and talent management, or highly effective contributions to promoting or improving health and wellbeing within the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortlisted nominees for the award are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart Matters Walk-Up Stairs &amp;amp; Space-My-Pace Walking Group/HMRC Table Tennis Club,  HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zoe Taylor, Ministry of Defence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to have the programme recognised through the Civil Service Awards. Congratulations to the other nominees who have been shortlisted. The winning programme or individual will be announced later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the Civil Service Awards at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilserviceawards.com&quot;&gt;www.civilserviceawards.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It’s been just over a month since &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/10/05/new-chair-statement&quot;&gt;I took over as Chair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s been a busy one! I’ve been working with our volunteer team to put together a new plan for the Network, through to December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan&quot;&gt;read the plan&lt;/a&gt; in full on our website. We’ll be adding to the plan over time, and using the same document to report on our progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use this post to explain the focus of the plan and to ask for your help in making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plan-thats-focused-and-ambitious&quot;&gt;A plan that’s focused and ambitious&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; engages more than 2,000 civil servants in its work. We reach you through simple things like our newsletters, or more involved things like our events or programmes. In line with our &lt;a href=&quot;/rules/mission-statement/&quot;&gt;mission statement and objectives&lt;/a&gt;, our plan for the next couple of years is focused on three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building inclusive communities of LGBT+ civil servants across the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping LGBT+ civil servants develop in their career&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acting as a centre of expertise about the experiences of LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan includes commitments to develop bespoke programmes for under-represented groups, engage allies, hold an annual workplace conference, reboot our social and networking opportunities and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plan-thats-realistic&quot;&gt;A plan that’s realistic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an ambitious plan and 2,000 members, it’s easy to lose sight of the most important thing about us: &lt;strong&gt;we’re all doing this as volunteers, on top of our day jobs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have paid staff. We don’t have a budget. Everything we do is, to a large extent, a lucky confluence of skills and timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’ll see in this plan is people coming forward to own things they know they can deliver. It is ambitious in what we are setting out to achieve but it is also realistic about how much we can take on at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also means we’re likely to say “no” to things more often, especially when we know that we don’t have a volunteer to take on the work. And that’s where you come in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-us-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;Help us to make this happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan is not an exhaustive list of everything we intend to do. It’s the things we want to try to do today based on the volunteer capacity we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading the plan and thinking to yourself: “&lt;em&gt;why doesn’t it include that thing I care about?&lt;/em&gt;”, the answer is simple. &lt;strong&gt;No one has volunteered to do it yet!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do is volunteer led – so if someone doesn’t volunteer, it doesn’t get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to help with a project we’ve listed in our plan or you’ve got your own idea you’d like to take forward, contact &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;one of the vice-chairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john.peart@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;contact me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure what you’d like to get involved with, we’ve also created a page where you can &lt;a href=&quot;/team/vacancies&quot;&gt;see specific roles we need help with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get involved! This is your Network, and things will only get done if we all pitch in.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve got work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service is an inclusive, welcoming and open place to work for LGBT+ staff. For many, your identity is no barrier to getting on with the job and progressing your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t true for everyone, and we still have a way to go. Whether it’s bullying, harassment and discrimination, career progression, or simply representation across the Civil Service; there is still work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to now lead this network. I want our work to help the Civil Service become the best employer it can be for LGBT+ people; an employer that &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; LGBT+ civil servant can say they are proud to work for, and proud to be themselves as part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I officially took over as Chair last Friday. I wanted to share a few thoughts about my priorities, and what you can expect from the network in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next&quot;&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the election, I said there was a number of things I wanted to focus on as chair. Those included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learning and development&lt;/strong&gt;: making sure the mentoring programme can run again next year, and planning an annual Civil Service LGBT+ conference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bullying and harassment&lt;/strong&gt;: creating an anti-bullying campaign and working with the permanent secretary champion to develop cross-government policy responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the new normal&lt;/strong&gt;: re-introducing our regular socials, developing new digital events, and creating a new online space for LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expertise and advice&lt;/strong&gt;: providing better data and resources for networks and organisations on the experiences fo LGBT+ staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;making the network work&lt;/strong&gt;: building on BiSpace with new programmes for LGBT+ women and ethnic minority staff, implementing new transparency mechanisms about the network’s work, and improving the deal for our volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of stuff to get done – so my first priority is going to be in putting together a sensible plan, and making sure we can deliver it. We will need help to make all this happen – so look out for opportunities to get involved over the next few weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst that planning is happening, the existing work of the network continues; in fact, some of the priorities I’ve noted above are already starting to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;Mentoring programme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring programme&lt;/a&gt; has been a big success already. More than 800 people have taken part in the scheme so far. I’m delighted to confirm today that the mentoring programme will be back next year, thanks in large part to the efforts of &lt;a href=&quot;https:///twitter.com/jonodrew&quot;&gt;Jonathan Kerr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan is helping us to build a new digital tool that will make our mentor matching process much faster; which means that we can run the programme more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reintroducing-our-socials&quot;&gt;Reintroducing our socials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our in-person social events have been on hold since the start of the pandemic. Following some trial events over the summer in a few locations, I’m pleased to announce that our usual programme will resume in London starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/10/07/civil-service-lgbt-monthly-social-london&quot;&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to our &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;local organiser team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will obviously keep this under review depending on the prevailing public health advice, but expect us to rotate around Westminster and Soho on the first Thursday of every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be working with our volunteers across the UK to see if we can restart socials at other locations in the coming weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to lose the great work the network has done during the pandemic to make online events great either. Our PrideON programme continues online, with a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/event/2021/10/21/create-your-own-pride-flag-workshop&quot;&gt;Create your own Pride flag&lt;/a&gt;’ workshop on 15 October, and I’ll be asking our volunteer team to look at developing a new programme of online-only events to compliment our in-person programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-operational-logistics&quot;&gt;Some operational logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our network has gotten too big to be supported by some of the online tools we use for free to keep in touch with our members, like our newsletter. I’m doing lots of boring back-end stuff at the moment to make sure we can all keep in touch online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might have noticed we refreshed our website this past weekend as a first step to give the network a fresh lick of paint as our new team takes shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-few-thank-yous&quot;&gt;A few thank yous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I wrap up, I wanted to thank Kate Hughes for her years of service to this Network, first as Vice-Chair and latterly as Chair. She has steered us through a period of immense uncertainty and made the Network a success despite the global pandemic. Her impact on the network will be felt for many years to come, and I know in her new role she will continue to champion the experience of LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to thank Jordon Zaman, who has stepped down as one of our vice-chairs this week. Jordon’s contribution to the Network has been excellent, and I know his presence will be missed in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you also to Alan Edwards, who was my opponent in the recent Chair’s election. Whoever won, the network would have been in safe hands, and I’m sure Alan will continue to play an active role in the network, particularly with our BiSpace programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weve-got-work-to-do&quot;&gt;We’ve got work to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very exciting opportunity for me to lead the Network, particularly at this moment as we re-emerge from the uncertainty of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see from this blog post, lots of work is already underway, there’s a lot planned too. I hope that you will get involved to help make this programme of activity happen. We’ve got work to do!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart&quot;&gt;John Peart&lt;/a&gt; is elected into the role of Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John has a wealth of experience in LGBT+ issues and has been a volunteer for the network in various capacities since 2013. If you would like to know more about him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement&quot;&gt;visit his election statement&lt;/a&gt;.
John will officially take over from me today but I will still be around for the next couple of weeks as we do an in-flight handover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-final-thought&quot;&gt;My final thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a privilege and a pleasure to lead this network, thank you all for your input and support. I’ll leave you with one final request which echoes the post I wrote a few weeks ago announcing that I was standing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This network exists for all of us, but it can’t survive on the efforts of a handful of people. There is an incredible amount of work going on in the background to make things happen and for that to continue we need members to volunteer their time and skills. Tell John what you want and need from your network, but then go one small step further and help him to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
