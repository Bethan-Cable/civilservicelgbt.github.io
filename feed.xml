  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; exists to ensure that each and every one of you can come to work each day feeling safe about being yourself. We do not want anyone to experience, or be in fear of experiencing, discrimination because they have a minority sexual orientation or gender identity. We believe that you will be more effective if you can be yourself at work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We also want to help make the Civil Service the most inclusive employer in the United Kingdom. We want to encourage a culture that supports workplace equality and engages with LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;our-mission-statement&quot;&gt;Our mission statement&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To deliver this vision, our mission to work to create a safe and inclusive working environment in the Civil Service, encouraging a culture which supports workplace equality and engages with LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;our-objectives&quot;&gt;Our objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To support the delivery of our vision and mission statement, our objectives are:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to offer advice to, and support the development of, departmental LGBT+ networks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to represent LGBT+ civil servants and local LGBT+ networks within the
Civil Service, including by raising awareness of the issues affecting LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to connect LGBT+ civil servants across government&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to provide support to individual civil servants where this is requested by their local LGBT+ network, or, by the individual themselves&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to function as a centre of expertise about sexual orientation and gender identity issues within the Civil Service – using this knowledge to shape Civil Service policy and practice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to facilitate access to learning and development opportunities for LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The objectives are kept under continuous review.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;!-- Don't remove the line of code above --&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;1. Name&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The name of the organisation is the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; (hereafter referred to as &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-civil-service-lgbt-network&quot;&gt;2. What is the Civil Service LGBT+ Network?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is the umbrella organisation of ‘grass roots’ staff networks that support civil servants who have a minority sexual orientation or gender identity (LGBT+) in central government departments, agencies and their associated public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; operates a membership system for individuals who are civil servants in central government departments, agencies and their associated public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The focus of &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is on issues of sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is an independent organisation that is neither affiliated with the management of the Civil Service nor the staff unions, and is independent of both.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;aim&quot;&gt;3. Aim&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is to work to create a safe and inclusive working environment in the Civil Service, encouraging a culture which supports workplace equality and engages with LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;4. Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The objectives of &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; are set out in the &lt;a href=&quot;/about/mission-statement&quot;&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;. As the objectives are likely to be subject to change, they are not included in this constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;membership&quot;&gt;5. Membership&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The membership of &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is made up of two categories: Member Networks and Individual Members.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Member Networks&lt;/strong&gt; are LGBT+ networks within Civil Service departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Members&lt;/strong&gt; are individual civil servants who support the aim of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;6. Governance&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; is run by volunteers taken from the membership. As such a formal committee with elected posts is impractical; the only elected post will be the Chair who will organise the available volunteers to support the mission statement of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The elected Chair will not have a fixed term of office but will remain in post for the length of time that they feel they can fulfil the role effectively unless either:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a majority of the membership is unhappy with their leadership, or&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;they have been in post for nine years at which point an election must be held anyway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a majority of the membership (51%) are unhappy with the leadership of the organisation and vote to this effect in a member’s meeting, then a full vote of all departments and arm’s length bodies must be called.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The formal vote of ‘no confidence’ will take place at the next members meeting so as to give each department or arm’s length the opportunity to conduct an internal vote in their department. The vote of ‘no confidence’ will then operate on a ‘one department, one vote’ basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Should a vote of ‘no confidence’ be carried, then an election is deemed to have been called. The timescales for this election will be agreed in the same member’s meeting as the vote of ‘no confidence’. Again this will occur on the basis of ‘one department, one vote’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The practical operation of this collegiate ‘one department, one vote’ system will be laid out in a separate Memorandum of Understanding document between &lt;strong&gt;CSLGBT+&lt;/strong&gt; and departmental LGBT networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For non-Chair election issues, any votes in a member’s meeting are conducted on the basis of one member one vote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;amendments&quot;&gt;7. Amendments&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Amendments to this constitution can be made by proposal in a member’s meeting. They will then be discussed and voted on at the next member’s meeting, so as to give member’s time to consider the proposals properly.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/24/local-presence-national-influence">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited and honoured to remain as a Vice Chair for our Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Over the past 2.5 years, you may have worked with me in supporting our regional teams and tasks. I want to thank you for your continuous support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three programmes that I feel very passionate about and will be leading on are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Face-to-face socials and networking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting local delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volunteer deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, our regional teams (local organisers) are growing from strength to strength. We now have dedicated teams of volunteers covering Scotland, Wales and large parts of England, including London, South East, South West, North East and North West. Our local organisers coordinate between their local department networks, help organise socials and events close to you. They are a vital part of our network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an ambitious plan to expand our teams to cover all parts of the UK. If you are based in Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England or Northern Ireland and would like to support our network, we are very keen to speak to you. You can get in touch by emailing us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very grateful for our local organisers and volunteers. We are working closely with Civil Service HR teams and the Civil Service LGB&amp;amp;TI Champion and will ensure your hard work and contribution is recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So join us and be part for our exciting journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you would like to volunteer as a local organiser in your area, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/24/activating-lgbt-allies-across-the-civil-service" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Activating LGBT+ allies across the Civil Service" />

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/24/activating-lgbt-allies-across-the-civil-service</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/24/activating-lgbt-allies-across-the-civil-service">&lt;p&gt;As a network, we think allies are important. That’s why our &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; includes a commitment to develop a new Allies programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be leading work to create that programme and resources that allies across the Civil Service can use to champion LGBT+ inclusion in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-by-listening-to-you&quot;&gt;Starting by listening to you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find out what LGBT+ civil servants want cisgender and heterosexual civil servants to be more aware of and how they can be better allies. I also want to know how you think LGBT+ civil servants can be more supportive to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a first step in creating this programme, I plan to conduct a survey and series of workshops to hear your voices. After that, I will publish a report of the findings alongside a plan of how I and volunteers will work to deliver it. 
My hypothesis is that a series of resources like fact sheets or blog posts might be helpful; but we’ll be led by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing these resources, it would be great to have LGBT+ people involved. Where people feel comfortable in doing so, it would be great to hear and share your stories and experiences to help raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-building-an-allies-team&quot;&gt;We’re building an Allies team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t do this all by myself! We’re going to build a  team of volunteers, both LGBT+ and allies from an array of departments, to put this programme and resources together. Our goal as a team will be to increase awareness of LGBT+ issues and allyship that can be shared widely across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an LGBT+ ally myself, I am passionate about equality and diversity and want to improve other people’s knowledge and understanding to help raise awareness and challenge stereotypes. It would be great to have like-minded volunteers onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to just create resources for allies created by allies, I really want input from our LGBT+ members too. Whether that be filling out the survey, coming to a workshop, volunteering or simply sharing the resources. Everyone can help make sure that our new programme engages and activates our allies to help make the Civil Service a great place to work for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-in-touch&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want allies on board from across a variety of Departments so that resources can be shared in non-LGBT+ spaces to reach people who would not usually engage with resources on allyship. I’d also like to hear from allies and non-LGBT+ people what they would find useful to help educate and challenge them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get involved with this team, please email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:leah.cunnah@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;leah.cunnah@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/22/trans-and-non-binary-inclusion-listening-sessions">&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;/team/alan-edwards&quot;&gt;Alan Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, my pronouns are they/he, and I’m the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s&lt;/strong&gt; new Vice Chair for trans and non-binary inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-space-for-trans-and-non-binary-members&quot;&gt;Creating space for trans and non-binary members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years, I’ve helped to run our BiSpace programme for bi+ civil servants. It’s made a huge difference to how welcomed I feel as a bi+ person in this Network. I want that same sense of community to be available for trans and non-binary people in the Civil Service too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from what works with BiSpace, we want to make the Civil Service and the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; the best place to work as a trans or non-binary person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to hear from our members, and indeed any civil servant who is trans or non-binary, to help shape this work. We will be working closely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agender.org.uk/&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt; to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-our-listening-sessions&quot;&gt;Join our listening sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be holding three listening sessions over the next month for you to share your views with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics I would like to explore during these events will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;awareness of the different types of events and activities carried out by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether people feel included in the events organised by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is there anything not currently being done by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; and a:gender that we ought to be doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events will take place on the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/12/02/trans-and-non-binary-listening-session-online-&quot;&gt;Thursday 2 December 2021, 17:00 to 18:00&lt;/a&gt; – Virtual&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/12/08/trans-and-non-binary-listening-session-in-person&quot;&gt;Wednesday 8 December 2021, 14:00 to 16:00&lt;/a&gt; – in person, London&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual events will be very informal, so please feel free to join and leave at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the in-person event in London on 8 December you will need to be registered as a visitor to 100 Parliament Street and be escorted through the building if you do not have an existing building pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to make these events but would like to share your views please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alan.edwards@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the listening sessions I will draft a trans and non-binary inclusion plan in the new year, which will be published on our website.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/22/restarting-the-leaders-of-networks-forum" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Restarting the Leaders of Networks forum" />
			<published>2021-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2021-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/22/restarting-the-leaders-of-networks-forum</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/22/restarting-the-leaders-of-networks-forum">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; is both a network of individual members and a network of networks. The structure of the Civil Service – which is made up for more than two dozen separate departments and more than 300 non-departmental bodies – means every organisation is different. They have different policies, procedures and culture. Having a local network is vital to ensure there is a constant link between LGBT+ staff on the ground and the management of every organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cross-government network, our role is to add unique value for local networks and ensure we don’t duplicate their efforts. Our ‘Leaders of Networks forum’ is one way we do that. It’s a regular chance for those running local departmental and agency networks to come together and discuss shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings have been on pause for a while during the pandemic; but I’m determined to restart them and ensure networks have that opportunity to collaborate and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-for-chairs-vice-chairs-or-committee-members&quot;&gt;It’s for chairs, vice chairs or committee members&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks forum isn’t open to everyone; as the name implies, it’s for those who are involved with running and leading their local departmental or agency network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be the network chair who attends. You can send a vice-chair or other committee member if you like. You can send more than one person too, if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-agenda-is-shaped-around-you&quot;&gt;The agenda is shaped around you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want these rebooted meetings to be laser-focused on issues or concerns networks are facing. Whilst we intend to have standing updates from the cross-government network team and from the Civil Service Inclusive Practice team, every meeting will also have plenty of time to focus on the things coming up across departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an agenda item you want to raise for our January meeting, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john.peart@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email me directly&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll see if I can squeeze it into the time available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dates-for-your-diary&quot;&gt;Dates for your diary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next Leaders of Networks forum will take place in January. We will then host the meetings on a quarterly basis from there on out: in April, July and October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dates and times for each meeting have already been scheduled, and you &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;find the full list on our events page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to register to attend each meeting, so make sure you complete the registration form. I hope to see lots of networks at our meeting in January.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/15/we-re-up-for-a-civil-service-award">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme – an initiative developed by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; – has been shortlisted in this year’s Civil Service Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new cross-departmental scheme. Since work began in April 2021, 425 mentors and 550 mentees have registered, more than 500 people have been given training, and more than 1,150 mentoring matches have been facilitated by the programme. By mid-2022, it will have generated more than 3,000 hours of mentoring. It is one of the largest mentoring programmes of its kind in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mentoring programme has nominated in the Developing and Supporting People Award category. The Developing and Supporting People Award recognises projects and individuals that demonstrate excellence across learning, skills development, strengthening capability, and talent management, or highly effective contributions to promoting or improving health and wellbeing within the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortlisted nominees for the award are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Zoe Taylor, Ministry of Defence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to have the programme recognised through the Civil Service Awards. Congratulations to the other nominees who have been shortlisted. The winning programme or individual will be announced later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/15/our-plan" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What we're planning to do" />
			<published>2021-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2021-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/15/our-plan</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/11/15/our-plan">&lt;p&gt;It’s been just over a month since &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2021/10/05/new-chair-statement&quot;&gt;I took over as Chair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s been a busy one! I’ve been working with our volunteer team to put together a new plan for the Network, through to December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan&quot;&gt;read the plan&lt;/a&gt; in full on our website. We’ll be adding to the plan over time, and using the same document to report on our progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use this post to explain the focus of the plan and to ask for your help in making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plan-thats-focused-and-ambitious&quot;&gt;A plan that’s focused and ambitious&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; engages more than 2,000 civil servants in its work. We reach you through simple things like our newsletters, or more involved things like our events or programmes. In line with our &lt;a href=&quot;/rules/mission-statement/&quot;&gt;mission statement and objectives&lt;/a&gt;, our plan for the next couple of years is focused on three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building inclusive communities of LGBT+ civil servants across the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping LGBT+ civil servants develop in their career&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acting as a centre of expertise about the experiences of LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan includes commitments to develop bespoke programmes for under-represented groups, engage allies, hold an annual workplace conference, reboot our social and networking opportunities and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plan-thats-realistic&quot;&gt;A plan that’s realistic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an ambitious plan and 2,000 members, it’s easy to lose sight of the most important thing about us: &lt;strong&gt;we’re all doing this as volunteers, on top of our day jobs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have paid staff. We don’t have a budget. Everything we do is, to a large extent, a lucky confluence of skills and timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’ll see in this plan is people coming forward to own things they know they can deliver. It is ambitious in what we are setting out to achieve but it is also realistic about how much we can take on at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also means we’re likely to say “no” to things more often, especially when we know that we don’t have a volunteer to take on the work. And that’s where you come in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-us-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;Help us to make this happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan is not an exhaustive list of everything we intend to do. It’s the things we want to try to do today based on the volunteer capacity we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading the plan and thinking to yourself: “&lt;em&gt;why doesn’t it include that thing I care about?&lt;/em&gt;”, the answer is simple. &lt;strong&gt;No one has volunteered to do it yet!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do is volunteer led – so if someone doesn’t volunteer, it doesn’t get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to help with a project we’ve listed in our plan or you’ve got your own idea you’d like to take forward, contact &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;one of the vice-chairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john.peart@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;contact me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure what you’d like to get involved with, we’ve also created a page where you can &lt;a href=&quot;/team/vacancies&quot;&gt;see specific roles we need help with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get involved! This is your Network, and things will only get done if we all pitch in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document explains what to do if, having completed your speed mentoring sessions as part of the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, you’ve decided that you still want a mentor or mentee, but that your speed mentoring matches weren’t suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;about-clearing-process&quot;&gt;About clearing process&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme was designed to match mentors and mentees through an initial set of speed mentoring sessions. Once those sessions are complete, mentors and mentees decide whether they want to work together over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not everyone will find a mentor or mentee through the process we have created. That is expected because:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there are different numbers of mentors and mentees on the programme at any one time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;some participants might not have been a ‘good’ match for each other, for various reasons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our clearing process is designed to match mentors and mentees that &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; find a match via speed mentoring 
sessions, but that still want to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is an informal and experimental process that we are running for the first time as part of the mentoring programme. You do not have to take part if you don’t want to. We cannot guarantee that this process will find you a mentor or mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you do want to take part, the remainder of this document explains how to take part in the clearing process.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;eligibility&quot;&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The clearing process is open to both mentors and mentees that &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; find a long-term match through the speed matching process.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; find a mentor or mentee, you &lt;strong&gt;should not&lt;/strong&gt; take part in the process, to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The clearing process will take place on our new forum: &lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt;. To take part in the process you should:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;register for an account on the forum by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;discuss.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;create a new post to advertise yourself to a prospective mentor or mentee&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;wait for prospective mentors or mentees to reply&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;register-for-an-account&quot;&gt;1. Register for an account&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;Discuss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a new online forum exclusively for LGBT+ civil servants and allies that we have created for mentors and mentees to connect. This system is being offered as a trial, but we are likely to expand it to be open to everyone in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can register for an account by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;discuss.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should register using your Civil Service email address. All account need to be verified by an administrator before you are granted access.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By registering to use the service you must agree to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt/privacy&quot;&gt;data policy&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt/tos&quot;&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, and to follow our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt/faq&quot;&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;create-your-mentee-or-mentor-advert&quot;&gt;2. Create your mentee or mentor ‘advert’&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you have access to the system, you need to create a post introducing yourself to prospective mentors or mentees. To do that:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;go to the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt/c/mentoring/clearing/11&quot;&gt;Clearing&lt;/a&gt;’ category&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;select the ‘+ New Topic’ button to create a new threaded post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;First, in the ‘Type title, or paste link here’ text input field, enter &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Mentor wanted]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Mentee wanted]&lt;/code&gt; followed by your name, grade and organisation. For example, if you are a mentee looking for a mentor, you would enter:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Mentor wanted] Alan Turing, G6, GCHQ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Next, enter some information about you and the kind of mentor or mentee you’d like to work with. In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Type here&lt;/code&gt; text area field, enter:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your name&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your grade&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your department or agency&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your profession&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;any other information about you that you think is relevant to your prospective matches&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the skills, experience or background of the mentor or mentee you are looking for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;warning-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The information you post in your topic is visible to all users of the forum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Don’t provide any information that you would not be comfortable sharing publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-for-people-to-reply&quot;&gt;3. Wait for people to reply&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Prospective mentors and mentees can reply to your ‘topic’ offering to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve found a match, post a final reply on your thread to let everyone else know that you’ve found a match. A moderator will then ‘close’ the thread to new replies.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/10/05/new-chair-statement">&lt;p&gt;We’ve got work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service is an inclusive, welcoming and open place to work for LGBT+ staff. For many, your identity is no barrier to getting on with the job and progressing your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t true for everyone, and we still have a way to go. Whether it’s bullying, harassment and discrimination, career progression, or simply representation across the Civil Service; there is still work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to now lead this network. I want our work to help the Civil Service become the best employer it can be for LGBT+ people; an employer that &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; LGBT+ civil servant can say they are proud to work for, and proud to be themselves as part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I officially took over as Chair last Friday. I wanted to share a few thoughts about my priorities, and what you can expect from the network in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next&quot;&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the election, I said there was a number of things I wanted to focus on as chair. Those included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learning and development&lt;/strong&gt;: making sure the mentoring programme can run again next year, and planning an annual Civil Service LGBT+ conference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bullying and harassment&lt;/strong&gt;: creating an anti-bullying campaign and working with the permanent secretary champion to develop cross-government policy responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the new normal&lt;/strong&gt;: re-introducing our regular socials, developing new digital events, and creating a new online space for LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expertise and advice&lt;/strong&gt;: providing better data and resources for networks and organisations on the experiences fo LGBT+ staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;making the network work&lt;/strong&gt;: building on BiSpace with new programmes for LGBT+ women and ethnic minority staff, implementing new transparency mechanisms about the network’s work, and improving the deal for our volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of stuff to get done – so my first priority is going to be in putting together a sensible plan, and making sure we can deliver it. We will need help to make all this happen – so look out for opportunities to get involved over the next few weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst that planning is happening, the existing work of the network continues; in fact, some of the priorities I’ve noted above are already starting to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;Mentoring programme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring programme&lt;/a&gt; has been a big success already. More than 800 people have taken part in the scheme so far. I’m delighted to confirm today that the mentoring programme will be back next year, thanks in large part to the efforts of &lt;a href=&quot;https:///twitter.com/jonodrew&quot;&gt;Jonathan Kerr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan is helping us to build a new digital tool that will make our mentor matching process much faster; which means that we can run the programme more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reintroducing-our-socials&quot;&gt;Reintroducing our socials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our in-person social events have been on hold since the start of the pandemic. Following some trial events over the summer in a few locations, I’m pleased to announce that our usual programme will resume in London starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/10/07/civil-service-lgbt-monthly-social-london&quot;&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to our &lt;a href=&quot;/team&quot;&gt;local organiser team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will obviously keep this under review depending on the prevailing public health advice, but expect us to rotate around Westminster and Soho on the first Thursday of every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be working with our volunteers across the UK to see if we can restart socials at other locations in the coming weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to lose the great work the network has done during the pandemic to make online events great either. Our PrideON programme continues online, with a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/event/2021/10/21/create-your-own-pride-flag-workshop&quot;&gt;Create your own Pride flag&lt;/a&gt;’ workshop on 15 October, and I’ll be asking our volunteer team to look at developing a new programme of online-only events to compliment our in-person programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-operational-logistics&quot;&gt;Some operational logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our network has gotten too big to be supported by some of the online tools we use for free to keep in touch with our members, like our newsletter. I’m doing lots of boring back-end stuff at the moment to make sure we can all keep in touch online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might have noticed we refreshed our website this past weekend as a first step to give the network a fresh lick of paint as our new team takes shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-few-thank-yous&quot;&gt;A few thank yous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I wrap up, I wanted to thank Kate Hughes for her years of service to this Network, first as Vice-Chair and latterly as Chair. She has steered us through a period of immense uncertainty and made the Network a success despite the global pandemic. Her impact on the network will be felt for many years to come, and I know in her new role she will continue to champion the experience of LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to thank Jordon Zaman, who has stepped down as one of our vice-chairs this week. Jordon’s contribution to the Network has been excellent, and I know his presence will be missed in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you also to Alan Edwards, who was my opponent in the recent Chair’s election. Whoever won, the network would have been in safe hands, and I’m sure Alan will continue to play an active role in the network, particularly with our BiSpace programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weve-got-work-to-do&quot;&gt;We’ve got work to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very exciting opportunity for me to lead the Network, particularly at this moment as we re-emerge from the uncertainty of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see from this blog post, lots of work is already underway, there’s a lot planned too. I hope that you will get involved to help make this programme of activity happen. We’ve got work to do!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/10/01/network-chair-election-results">&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart&quot;&gt;John Peart&lt;/a&gt; is elected into the role of Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John has a wealth of experience in LGBT+ issues and has been a volunteer for the network in various capacities since 2013. If you would like to know more about him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement&quot;&gt;visit his election statement&lt;/a&gt;.
John will officially take over from me today but I will still be around for the next couple of weeks as we do an in-flight handover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-final-thought&quot;&gt;My final thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a privilege and a pleasure to lead this network, thank you all for your input and support. I’ll leave you with one final request which echoes the post I wrote a few weeks ago announcing that I was standing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This network exists for all of us, but it can’t survive on the efforts of a handful of people. There is an incredible amount of work going on in the background to make things happen and for that to continue we need members to volunteer their time and skills. Tell John what you want and need from your network, but then go one small step further and help him to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/11/election-update-personal-statements-and-hustings">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-candidates&quot;&gt;The Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each candidate has written an election statement. You can find Alan’s statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/alan-edwards-election-statement&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and John’s statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The next stage in the election process is to hold hustings so you can ask the candidates questions and hear more from them on their vision for the Network and its future. We will hold two hustings sessions via video conference during the week commencing 13 September 2021. One will be at lunchtime and one will be towards the end of the day to enable as many people as possible to attend. Details of the events and how to attend and register questions will be posted on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events&quot;&gt;Events page&lt;/a&gt; our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the hustings there will be a voting period. Each member network has one vote they can cast in the election and member networks must canvas either all members or all network committee members. Please contact your local LGBT+ network to find out details of how they are managing this part of the process. Network leaders who still need to register their network to vote should do so by emailing kate.hughes@cabinetoffice.gov.uk by 12 noon on 15 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The window for member networks to cast their vote is noon on 22 September 2021 to noon on 29 September 2021. Registered networks will receive details of how to cast their vote after 15 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find all published material relating to the election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/topic/election-2021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="John Peart (he/him) Election Statement" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement">&lt;h2 id=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m John Peart. In my day job, I’m a Bill Manager in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. I’ve been a Vice-chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network for around 3 years, and now I’m standing to be the Network’s next Chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-record&quot;&gt;My record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; first as a volunteer, then as Communications and Events Lead, and most recently as a Vice-Chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;joined our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;been part of our groups at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart/status/1276822514606497792&quot;&gt;Pride in London&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/06/01/civil-service-pride-season-starts-now/&quot;&gt;elsewhere around the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seen our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/2014/10/01/role-models-inspiring-lgb-people-in-the-civil-service/&quot;&gt;role models guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/2017/10/30/civil-service-impact-index/&quot;&gt;Impact Index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taken part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/allies-week/&quot;&gt;Allies Week&lt;/a&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/podcast/&quot;&gt;our podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve seen my work, and you know I get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you have simply been to our social events, visited this website, or emailed in a question over the past 8 years, you’ve probably spoken to me or seen my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started volunteering for (then) the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance, the network was 100 people on an Excel spreadsheet and a monthly social in central London. Thanks to my work, and the work of other volunteers, this network is now the largest, most active network in the Civil Service: 2,000 members strong and counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m standing to be Chair because there’s more we can do, together, to make the Civil Service a great employer for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-vision&quot;&gt;My vision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, like everything else, has had to adapt to the pandemic. I want to use the next two years to build on what worked in the pandemic, and to also take advantage of a return to something more normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want every LGBT+ civil servant to feel like they have a national employee network that they are connected to: whether that’s through our programmes, through in-person events, or online. It shouldn’t matter where you live; you should be able to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-plan&quot;&gt;My plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make that a reality, and if elected as Chair of the Network, these would be my priorities for the next 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-focus-on-learning-and-development&quot;&gt;1. Focus on learning and development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cross-government network we are uniquely placed to facilitate inter-departmental learning and development opportunities. The success of the mentoring programme that I’ve led this year shows that. So I want to do more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elected as Chair, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure the new mentoring programme runs again in 2022 and 2023&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliver an annual, national conference for LGBT+ civil servants focused on development and career progression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-tackle-bullying-harassment-and-discrimination&quot;&gt;2. Tackle bullying, harassment and discrimination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT+ civil servants still too frequently experience bullying, harassment and discrimination. I want to tackle this long-running issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elected as Chair, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create an anti-bullying, harassment and discrimination campaign that can be used and re-used by networks and departments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work with the new permanent secretary champion and Civil Service HR to develop cross-departmental policy responses to these issues in a way that is sensitive to the cross-cutting identities LGBT+ staff have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-make-the-most-of-the-new-normal&quot;&gt;3. Make the most of the New Normal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic meant your cross-government Network went fully digital. I want to capture what worked and keep doing it, whilst bringing back our face-to-face events too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elected as Chair, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;look to re-introduce our regular social events across the UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;develop a new programme of digital events to compliment our in-person events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a new online space for LGBT+ civil servants and allies to talk, collaborate and work together on shared issues affecting LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-provide-expertise-and-advice&quot;&gt;4. Provide expertise and advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly local LGBT+ networks and teams want trusted resources they can use to inform internal HR policy or even to just present at team meetings. I want to make it easy to find the materials you need to talk to your colleagues, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elected as Chair, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a new online tool that Networks and departmental teams can use to access data about the experience of LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;produce a range of materials suitable for “lunch and learn” type events that Networks can use and adapt internally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-making-the-network-work&quot;&gt;5. Making the Network work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to keep improving the way the Network &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; to ensure it can continue to benefit you. I want to ensure the Network is transparent, accountable and can scale to meet the needs of our 2,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elected as Chair, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;initiate community listening exercises so we can repeat the success of BiSpace for other under-represented groups including LGBT+ women and ethnic minority staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure we have a business plan is transparent, regularly updated, and that you can scrutinise through regular Chair’s Question Time sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the offer and deal for our volunteers, ensuring they are recognised in their departments for the contribution they give to the Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-vote&quot;&gt;So… Vote!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 8 years, I’ve proved I can deliver. I’ve shown I have the ideas, the passion, the energy and the enthusiasm to deliver for LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vote for me is a vote to continue that work; to improve our processes, to take advantage of the new normal, to make our work more expansive and inclusive, and to deliver on issues that the evidence shows us matters the most to LGBT+ staff across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/alan-edwards-election-statement">&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-background&quot;&gt;Personal Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the Civil Service in 2014 and have worked at HMRC, the Serious Fraud Office and am currently on secondment to NHS Test and Trace, where I work as a Counter Fraud Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am bisexual, non-binary and neurodiverse. I first realised I was bi when I was 19. Unsure of how to communicate that to people or worried about how it might be viewed, I did not tell anyone beyond a group of close friends for several years. Eventually it got to a point where keeping such a big part of who I am a secret and constantly having my sexuality assumed by the gender of my partner became more of a burden than the fear of how people might react if I told them I was bi. Because there was no network and very little LGBT+ visibility at the department where I was working at that time, I decided to write a blog post about being bisexual and invisible. This received positive feedback from across the organisation and led to more people talking about LGBT+ issues and the formation of a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-lgbt-network-involvement&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first became involved in the CSLGBT+ Network in December 2019, when I joined the Network’s Bi+ Inclusion Team. In that role I have helped organise countless events, covering topics such as being out at work, intersectionality and allyship. I felt that it was particularly important to keep the bi+ community connected during the pandemic, when many of us were cut off from our usual support networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also helped to set up AceSpace, a series of structured and informal social events for civil servants on the asexual and aromantic spectrums. This is a group who are often forgotten and underrepresented in the LGBT+ community and benefited from having a dedicated space, often giving them the opportunity to meet other ace people for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have represented the Network at the Cabinet Office’s Vetting Transformation Programme, which is reviewing the way that the security clearance process is handled. This has historically discriminated against LGBT+ people (until 1991 it was official government policy not to employ LGBT+ people at the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office and in other security related roles). I know from speaking to many of you that it’s still a big cause of anxiety, sometimes even to the extent that LGBT+ people will not apply for certain jobs. I have worked with the Cabinet Office for the last year to ensure that our community’s views are taken into account, so that the vetting process can be updated to be fit for the times we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of my coming out blog post I co-founded and co-chaired the Serious Fraud Office LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was at the SFO I was additionally the Deputy Lead of the Mental Health and Wellbeing Group. I organised the first event talking about the intersection between mental health, sexual orientation and gender identity, which was well attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-pitch&quot;&gt;My Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been closeted for several years before coming out quite publicly, I understand the challenges that can come with being an LGBT+ civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been involved with the CSLGBT+ Network for some time and have good relationships with the volunteers that help to run it, the other cross government diversity networks, and some of the Network’s key stakeholders in the government. I would be well placed to ensure continuity of the vital work that the Network does, while also looking at new things we can do to ensure that we support every LGBT+ civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that eventually gave me the courage to come out was reading an Employment Tribunal case about a bisexual prison officer who was bullied, harassed and eventually unlawfully dismissed for his sexual orientation in 2016. Knowing that this had happened to a fellow civil servant, at a time when I worked in the Civil Service, made me feel that I had an obligation to make myself visible in the hope that it might help prevent something similar happening to anyone else. I will carry the same conviction with me if elected Chair of the Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;priorities&quot;&gt;Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My priorities for the CSLGBT+ Network would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·   	Advocacy – I will ensure that the Network consistently advocates in the interests of LGBT+ civil servants, whether through initiatives such as the Vetting Transformation Programme or raising employment policies that affect us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·   	Cooperation with other networks – I want to continue and build on the good relationships the Network enjoys with other cross government diversity networks, as well as departmental LGBT+ networks. I would like to see more joint events and will encourage us to work together on intersectional equality issues affecting our members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·   	Building our community – I have seen how much difference having a dedicated team for one part of the LGBT+ community can make through the work I have done on the Network’s Bi+ Inclusion Team. I will ensure that each part of the LGBT+ community has a dedicated Vice Chair in the Network to act as an advocate and organise events for their sub-community. I will expect these strands to be in regular contact with each other and work closely together, to ensure that intersectionality remains at the heart of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·   	Intersectionality – I see this as more than just a popular catchphrase but as something that’s essential to a diversity network like ours. My sexuality, gender and neurodivergence do not exist in isolation but together shape who I am and the experiences I have had, both positive and negative. While our Network is focused on sexuality and gender diversity, I want us to keep in mind how characteristics like people’s ethnicity, faith, cultural and socioeconomic background, mental and physical health, and disability affect and intersect with their experiences as LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to e-meeting as many of you as possible over the coming weeks and answering any questions you have.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/08/31/speed-matching-is-complete">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new development opportunity for civil servants with minority sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and variations in sex characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created this programme because we know LGBT+ civil servants say they feel they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t get the same develop opportunities as their non-LGBT+ colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can’t often identify LGBT+ role models who are more senior than than across government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opened the programme for the first time in June 2021. More than 850 people registered as either a mentor, mentee or both before our 31 July 2021 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve been matching mentors to mentees. &lt;strong&gt;The matching process is now complete, and you should have received your matches via email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-matching-worked&quot;&gt;How matching worked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone registering for the programme told us their:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;role&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;department&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;formal Civil Service profession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A match was made when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a mentor was one or two grades more senior than the mentee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a mentor was in a different department to the mentee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to make sure mentees were matched with at least one person from the same profession as them. We also deliberately mixed up the professions for most people, so they got to meet people across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every mentee that registered on the programme has been matched with at least 1 mentor&lt;/strong&gt;. Most mentees have been matched with 2 or 3 mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were unable to match around 20 mentors to a suitable mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next&quot;&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should have received an email with your mentoring matches in it&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mentor&lt;/strong&gt; – your email will have the name, grade, role, department and profession of your mentees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mentee&lt;/strong&gt; – your email will have the name, grade, role, department and profession of your mentor &lt;em&gt;as well as&lt;/em&gt; their email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentees should now contact their mentors to arrange a speed mentoring session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;didnt-get-an-email&quot;&gt;Didn’t get an email?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t receive your mentoring matches via email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;check your ‘Junk’ or ‘Spam’ folder for an email from: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;civil.service.lgbt.mentoring.programme@notifications.service.gov.uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you can’t see one, email us at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mentoring@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt; is an online community space exclusively for LGBT+&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:LGBT&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:LGBT&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; civil servants and allies. It’s a forum provided by the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document explains the Community Guidelines that apply to use of the forum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;general-behaviours&quot;&gt;General behaviours&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We want &lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt; to be a welcoming, inclusive environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We consider the forum to be an extension of your workplace. We expect that everyone using the forum holds themselves to the same standards of conduct and behaviour as they would in their ordinary place of work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If your conduct is not suitable for your workplace, we also consider it to be unsuitable on our forum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-code&quot;&gt;Civil Service Code&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All civil servants – regardless of their role or grade – are bound by the Civil Service Code. We expect everyone using &lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt; to uphold the core Civil Service values of ‘integrity’, ‘honesty’, ‘objectivity’ and ‘impartiality’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In particular, we expect that users of the forum will always act in a way that:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;is professional&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;is fair, just and equitable&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reflects the Civil Service commitment to equality and diversity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;maintains political impartiality, no matter what their own political beliefs are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;our-rules&quot;&gt;Our rules&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-the-discussion&quot;&gt;1. Improve the discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Help us to make this a great place for discussion. You should:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;always add something positive or constructive to the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;look for existing conversation threads (“topics”) to reply to before starting your own&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;always be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;be-agreeable-even-when-you-disagree&quot;&gt;2. Be agreeable, even when you disagree&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to &lt;em&gt;criticize ideas, not people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should &lt;strong&gt;avoid&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;name-calling&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;personal attacks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;knee-jerk contradiction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;leave-things-better-than-you-found-them&quot;&gt;3. Leave things better than you found them&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Every topic and post on &lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt; sets the tone for new joiners to the community. Help us to make the forum an interesting place to be, and to avoid those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The forum provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;if-you-see-a-problem-flag-it&quot;&gt;4. If You See a Problem, Flag It&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s everyone’s job to keep this forum a safe and inclusive community that everyone feels a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you see someone acting poorly, you should:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;not reply to the post&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use the ‘flag’ feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We do not pre-screen new posts; we take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;always-be-civil&quot;&gt;5. Always be civil&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness. You should always:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be civil&lt;/strong&gt; – don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;respect each other&lt;/strong&gt; – don’t harass anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;respect the forum&lt;/strong&gt; – don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whilst only civil servants are permitted to register for this site, this is a public forum. Don’t post anything you wouldn’t want others to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-tidy&quot;&gt;6. Keep It Tidy&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. You should not:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;cross-post the same thing in multiple topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post no-content replies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;divert a topic by changing it midstream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;sign your posts – every post has your profile information attached to it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use the “Like” button rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use the “Reply as a Linked Topic” feature rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;only-post-your-own-stuff&quot;&gt;7. Only post your own stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should not:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post anything that belongs to someone else without permission&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post any documents or information that has not been already put into the public domain&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;disclose information that you do not have the right to disclose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.civilservice.lgbt/about&quot;&gt;staff page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;about-this-publication&quot;&gt;About this publication&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This publication explains the reputation system that applies to the use of our forum, Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-reputation-system&quot;&gt;About the reputation system&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our forum uses a system of ‘reputation’ to ensure that our online community stays safe, and to guide you through your first few weeks and months of participating in the community. It helps us to keep conversation friendly and prevent SPAM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have 5 different reputation levels – from Magenta to Platinum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;magenta--for-new-users&quot;&gt;Magenta – for new users&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By default, all new users start out with Magenta reputation, meaning they need to earn reputation as a trusted user.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a Magenta user, you won’t be able to do some things until you’ve learnt the community norms and the way our community works.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You won’t be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send personal messages to other users&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use the “reply as new topic” function&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;flag posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post more than 1 image&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post any attachments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post more than 2 hyperlinks in a post&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;have links in the ‘about me’ field of their profile&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;mention more than 2 users in a post&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post more than 3 topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;post more than 10 replies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;edit their own posts after more than 24 hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;bronze--for-novice-users&quot;&gt;Bronze – for novice users&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can be promoted to Bronze reputation by just reading things other people have posted on the community. You get trust Bronze reputation by:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;opening at least &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reading at least &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;spending a total of &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; minutes reading posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got Bronze reputation, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use all the core functions of the website; all new user restrictions are removed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send private messages&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;upload images and attachments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;edit wiki posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;flag posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;mute other users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;silver--for-regular-users&quot;&gt;Silver – for regular users&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you keep participating in the community, you can earn Silver reputation. Get to Silver reputation by:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;visiting at least &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; days, not sequentially&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;casting at least &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; like&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;receiving at least &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; like&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;replying to at least &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; different topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;entering at least &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reading at least &lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;spending a total of &lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; minutes reading posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you have Silver reputation, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use the “Invite others to this topic” button to invite brand new users to participate in topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;invite outside users to private messages making a group private message&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;like and edit posts more often&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;add users to a personal ignore list&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;edit your posts for up to 30 days after posting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;gold--for-frequent-users&quot;&gt;Gold – for frequent users&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you get to Gold reputation, you’re showing you’re the most active readers and reliable contributors to our community. To get Gold reputation, in the last 100 days:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;you must have visited the forum on &lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; separate days&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;you have replied to at least &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; different topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;of the topics created in the last 100 days, must have viewed &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt; of them&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;of the posts created in the last 100 days, must have read &lt;strong&gt;5%&lt;/strong&gt; of them&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;you must have received &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; likes, and given &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; likes.*&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;you must not have received more than 5 spam or offensive flags&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;must not have been suspended or silenced in the last 6 months&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gold reputation isn’t permanent – use it or you lose it! The system checks these stats every 100 days. All of the above criteria must be true to achieve Gold reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you have Gold reputation, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;access “The Village” – an exclusive category just for Gold reputation users and above&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;recategorise and rename topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;hide SPAM posts from Magenta reputation users for everyone else&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;like and edit posts more often&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;platinum--for-community-leaders&quot;&gt;Platinum – for community leaders&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Users with Platinum reputation are our most trusted users. They set a positive example for the community through their actions and their posts. If you need advice, these are the folks you turn to first, and they’ve earned the highest level of community trust, such that they are almost moderators within the community already.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Very few users get to Platinum reputation – they are granted this status by administrators and moderators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Users with Platinum reputation can:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;edit all posts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;pin/unpin topic&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;close topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;archive topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;make topics unlisted&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;split and merge topics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reset topic bump date&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;like and edit posts more often&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;moderators-and-admins&quot;&gt;Moderators and admins&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We also have a series of users who act as moderators and administrators for the forum; they tend to be people directly involved in running the Network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the resignation of Kate Hughes as chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, an election for the next Chair of the Network has been triggered. The only role stipulated in our constitution is the role of Chair; all other roles are created and organised by the Chair.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The election of the chair will be via  a “first past the post” ballot of eligible departmental or agency networks. Each eligible departmental or agency LGBT+ network may cast one vote on behalf of all members in their network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The list of eligible networks will be taken from the LGBT networks listed on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The vote must come from a registered email address that we have for that network or a nominated alternative. The voting email address cannot be one that belongs to a candidate standing in the election. Details of how to confirm the email address being used will be sent to our current list of Leaders of Networks by 27 August.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If your organisation’s LGBT network is not listed on our website please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so we can validate that you are eligible to vote as an organisation and confirm details before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Candidates can stand alone or on a joint ticket as Co-chairs. If standing on a joint ticket then all parties on that ticket are deemed to be elected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-timeline&quot;&gt;The Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nominations for candidates wishing to stand as Chair will be open from the publication of this post until 12:00 noon on Monday 6 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following confirmation of candidates on 6 September 2021, each ticket will be invited to submit a 1000 word blog post outlining their priorities, proposals and pitch for the role. This will be published on the Network’s website. The deadline for submitting those blog posts will be 8 September 2021 and they will be published unedited on 9 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Virtual hustings events will take place during week commencing 13th September. These will be held via video conference and open to all members to dial into.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Voting by member networks will open at noon on 22 September 2021 and close at noon on 29 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Departmental and agency networks must hold an internal vote within their network to determine who they will support. The vote can take place in any format the network deems appropriate, but must either be a canvas of all members or of all network committee members.The network’s vote must be received from the nominated email address by 12:00 noon on 29 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The result will be announced on our website on 30 September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How to Nominate
Candidates must self-nominate by email. Candidates standing as co-chairs must email separately, referencing who they are standing on a joint ticket with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To nominate yourself please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kate.hughes@cabinetoffice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;kate.hughes@cabinetoffice.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; from your Civil Service email address stating clearly that you wish to stand for election, anyone else you will be standing on a joint ticket with, and confirming which civil service organisation you are currently employed by. Only individuals employed directly by the Civil Service are eligible to stand for election; interim or agency workers are not eligible to stand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This role involves a significant commitment so we would advise you to speak to your line manager prior to nominating yourself in order to identify how much time you would be able to commit to the role. Your department is not obliged to support you but is encouraged to recognise the role as your corporate contribution objective and allow you 10% FTE official time to facilitate attending meetings during the working week. The role will almost certainly require time commitment outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the role or the process please contact Kate on &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/08/10/kate-hughes-to-step-down-as-chair-of-the-civil-service-lgbt-network">&lt;p&gt;After almost four years in the role of Chair for one of the longest-running Civil Service-wide employee networks I have decided that the time is right to pass the baton on to someone else (not just because I’ve been watching too many Olympic relays!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grateful&quot;&gt;Grateful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to lead this network and I couldn’t be prouder of the team and everything that they and the wider network have achieved over the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took over this role from Ollie Entwistle (a tough act to follow!) the workplace and the network looked very different to what we experience today. I never imagined that four years later we would be thriving in an online space, having delivered PrideON the biggest pride season we’ve ever done entirely via Zoom/Hangouts/Teams (to be honest I’m not sure Zoom even existed when I was elected and I’m certain it wasn’t on government IT security approved lists!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-weve-achieved&quot;&gt;What we’ve achieved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was elected John Peart and I consulted with you and set out priorities based on your responses to that consultation. The Network has delivered against almost all of those priorities, as well as picking up some additional projects along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we switched to an online way of working we had secured funding to have a coordinated, official presence at each of the capital city Pride events across the UK. A huge project for a small group of volunteers and a first for the Civil Service, giving us an excellent opportunity to demonstrate just how great we are as a group of colleagues, with the added bonus of highlighting the work the Civil Service does for the LGBT+ public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to do on working with religious communities within the Civil Service but we’ve built much stronger ties with a significant number of the other cross-government networks. We’ve built up the number of allies engaged with us, supporting them to be more visible and active in their allyship. We’ve increased our membership to the point where we regularly have to review how to manage within the limits of the free software we use to send emails! We’ve created “spotlight on” role model profiles based around different parts of our communities, and we are working on a new programme to deliver events and products specifically with the women in our network in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most significantly of all we’ve gone totally digital, enabling our members across the world not only to access our events, products, comms and support but also to more easily create and run them. This has reduced the “postcode lottery” around the in-person events, and has created different, stronger connections across the whole country. It has also enabled us to deliver a mentoring programme that is frankly huge and is something I’ve been wanting to manage for a long time, finally with departments embracing video conferencing it is now achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However none of this would have been possible without the support of the large number of volunteers that have got involved over the four years. Thank you to all of you, whatever your contribution has been, but particularly thank you to the regional team who did sterling work before the pandemic running events and creating local networks, and who pivoted to doing that online very quickly when the world suddenly changed. The biggest thanks of all though goes to the team of Vice-Chairs that have supported me over the last four years. Each of them has delivered above and beyond, demonstrating dedication, talent and dynamism that has been inspiring and which I know has made a difference to the working lives of every single member of this network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-final-thought&quot;&gt;My final thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final thought before I finish is this: this network is about all of us, it doesn’t work without the volunteers that get involved - as corporate contribution or in their own time – to make it the success that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please make the network your own – tell whoever replaces me what you want from it, and where possible help them to achieve that by volunteering your time and skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/08/02/mentoring-registrations-are-now-closed">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new initiative from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. It aims to give LGBT+ civil servants support in developing their career by speaking to more senior LGBT+ mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The registration period for the 2021 programme has now closed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-next&quot;&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that registrations are closed, we will start the process of matching mentors and mentees. We expect to have finished this process in August, at which point all mentors and mentees will receive an email confirming their matches. If you &lt;em&gt;have not&lt;/em&gt; heard from us by 1 September, please email us to ask for an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also update our &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring page&lt;/a&gt; when we have sent the final notifications out, so you know you won’t have missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst you wait for your matches, you might also want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attend one of our &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;mentoring induction events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;read our guidance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/resources-for-mentors&quot;&gt;mentors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/resources-for-mentees&quot;&gt;mentees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;complete our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/consultation/mentoring-pre-programme-survey&quot;&gt;pre-programme survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-didnt-register&quot;&gt;If you didn’t register&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not register, you cannot take part in the programme this time and will have to wait until next year. The programme is large and administratively intensive; because of this, we cannot make any exceptions. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document includes advice, guidance and resources for mentors taking part in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network mentoring programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Separate advice is available for &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/resources-for-mentees&quot;&gt;mentees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;your-role-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Your role as a mentor&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-mean-by-mentoring&quot;&gt;What we mean by mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentoring is a relationship between two people: a ‘mentor’ and a ‘mentee’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of mentoring relationship. For the &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, experienced, more senior LGBT+ civil servants like you act as mentors to less experienced, generally more junior, mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the mentoring relationship, you’re being asked to informally share your knowledge and experience with your mentees to support their professional and career development. Your role will likely be a mixture of giving advice, tutoring and coaching mentees to think about how to develop their skills, solve problems, and move their career forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-good-looks-like&quot;&gt;What good looks like&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to approach a mentoring relationship, and each mentor brings different skills and experience to the table. There’s no “right way” to be a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We think that great mentors:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are self-aware&lt;/strong&gt;, with a good understanding of their own strengths and development needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have good communication skills&lt;/strong&gt;, with an ability to ‘actively listen’ to mentees and to approach conversations in an open, respectful way&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are empathetic&lt;/strong&gt; and have a willingness to understand different perspectives and approaches of mentees&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are encouraging and inspiring&lt;/strong&gt; their mentees by challenging mentees to step up, role modelling positive behaviours and providing positive feedback&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;act as brokers&lt;/strong&gt; by linking mentees to resources, opportunities and people in their networks that might help them to learn and grow&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can recognise risks&lt;/strong&gt; and can help mentees understand them so they can take appropriate risks at work and in their career&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are trustworthy&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning they keep conversations with their mentees confidential, are reliable, and follow through on their promises&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maintain boundaries&lt;/strong&gt; so that the mentoring relationship remains appropriate for the workplace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These are just examples. Not every mentor will be able to do all of these all the time. This may provide a framework for you to think through where your own development needs are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-being-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Benefits of being a mentor&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Being a mentor can be a rewarding experience. As a mentor in the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;, we hope you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;support your own career development by learning new skills, and developing your leadership and communications capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gain insight and perspective from in other parts of government&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use your mentoring role as evidence of a strong corporate contribution, as part of your performance management process&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;feel good about supporting the development of the other LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve published some perspectives from mentors joining the programme on our blog. &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;Visit the mentoring page&lt;/a&gt; to read the blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-as-part-of-the-programme&quot;&gt;What to do as part of the programme&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you have been asked to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;meet with up to 3 mentees for a ‘speed mentoring’ session&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;choose 1 mentee from those 3 mentees you meet to mentor longer term&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The following sections explain how you could structure the time you spend with your mentees during their ‘speed mentoring’ session and in later sessions if you have them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;your-speed-mentoring&quot;&gt;Your speed mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;before-the-session&quot;&gt;Before the session&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After we have completed the matching exercise, your mentees will individually contact you to arrange a speed mentoring session. We will send you the names of your mentees as part of the matching process.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A speed mentoring session is a one-off session, and it should last for around 30 minutes. As each mentor will be paired with a maximum of 3 mentees, the initial time commitment from you is likely to be around 1 hour, 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-session&quot;&gt;During the session&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Each speed mentoring session will be different and 30 minutes isn’t very long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve recommended that mentees come to their speed mentoring session prepared to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;tell you whether they just want some one-off advice now or are looking for a mentor long term&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;explain why they signed up to get a mentor and what they hope a mentor can help them with&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;talk about their career journey so far and ask you about your skills, experience and career journey&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;bring one issue to the meeting that they’d like some quick advice about&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have asked mentees to lead the session as far as possible. As a mentor, it’s your role to steer the session and try to open up the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Try to ask ‘open’ questions throughout the session to keep the conversation moving and get your mentee to do most of the talking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;conversation-prompts&quot;&gt;Conversation prompts&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These are some topics and prompts you might want to discuss. Don’t rigidly stick to these topics – go with the flow of the conversation – but these prompts may help you to keep the conversation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Career history and ambitions&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Encourage your mentee to set out what they currently do, what they’ve done before, and to explain their long term ambitions. Describe your own career history and journey through the Civil Service too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you do for your current role?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Tell me about your career so far. What have you done?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Why did you join the Civil Service?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What did you do before joining the Civil Service?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What motivates you to go to work in the morning?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Where do you see yourself in 1 year, 3 years, and 10 years?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Strengths and weaknesses&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ask your mentee to tell you what they feel they are good at and what they want to develop. Discuss with your mentee how they think a mentor can help them to plug those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is your greatest strength and your greatest weakness?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you struggle with at work?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How would your colleagues describe you to someone else?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What upcoming learning or development have you have planned?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you enjoy most and least about your current job?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Why did you sign up to get a mentor?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What’s the most important think you want a mentor to help you with?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;The issue&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If they have prepared a specific topic or ‘issue’ they want to discuss with you, try to help them think around the issue. If you’ve been in a similar situation before, explain how you approached it or how you would do things differently if you did it again.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Your goal is not necessarily to give your mentee “the answer” but to help them think more widely about the issue and how they have agency to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to address issue? Why is it important to you?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is the impact of this issue at the moment?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What have you tried so far? Did it work, and if not why not?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What other options have you considered or tried?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;after-the-session&quot;&gt;After the session&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentees get matched with multiple mentors. We’ve done this so that both mentors and mentees can get a broad sense of their options, and whether they are a good match for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After all of their speed mentoring sessions have taken place, one or more of your mentees might contact you to ask you to be their mentor long-term. If you didn’t cover it in your speed mentoring, ask them questions about what they want to get out of a mentoring relationship with you, so that you can decide if you can help them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Think carefully about whether you have the time available to properly commit to supporting a mentee, and whether your skills, experience, expertise and networks are a good fit to help them. We would anticipate you meeting with your chosen mentee once every 4 to 8 weeks for up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We hope that each mentor will agree to support at least one mentee long term.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;your-long-term-mentoring&quot;&gt;Your long term mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you agree to act as a mentor for someone long term, then it is for you and your mentee to agree how you want your mentoring relationship to work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The amount of time mentors and mentees spend together will depend on what the mentee wants to get out of the relationship. In general, we recommend that you meet your mentee:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;once every 4 to 8 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;for up to an hour&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;for up to a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should agree how you want to work together either during or before your first full mentoring session.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you find that the time commitment is getting too much, then be honest with your mentee about the other commitments you have and negotiate a change to your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will contact you throughout the next year to see how your relationship with your mentee is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;techniques-for-mentoring&quot;&gt;Techniques for mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve compiled a list of resources that you might find helpful to for your mentoring sessions. These resources are sourced from third parties and Civil Service LGBT+ Network did not produce these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;prompting-your-mentee-to-prepare&quot;&gt;Prompting your mentee to prepare&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The best mentoring sessions are ones that both mentees and mentors have prepared for. You might want to get your mentee to write down what topics they want to explore in advance of each of your meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;conversation-prompts-1&quot;&gt;Conversation prompts&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Questions to ask&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What issues would you like to discuss in the session?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What are the key challenges you are currently facing?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What outcomes would you like to achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What would make it a successful session?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Please can you e-mail the key challenges you would like to discuss during our (next) mentoring session?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;grow-model&quot;&gt;“GROW” model&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The GROW model is a simple framework that can be applied to goal setting and problem solving. The technique helps mentees to identify their ‘Goal’, establish the ‘Reality’ of their current situation, the ‘Options’ to consider or ‘Obstacles’ to overcome, and then plan a ‘Way forward’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;conversation-prompts-2&quot;&gt;Conversation prompts&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Goal&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Start by helping your mentee to establish an appropriate objective.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you want to talk about?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you want to get out of this conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What do you want to achieve (short and longer-term)?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How will you know when you have achieved it?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What might be the steps along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Reality&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ask your mentee to think about what their goal would look like in practical terms.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is happening now that makes this an issue/makes you want to change?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Who is involved or affected? Directly? Indirectly?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What are the underlying causes ?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What have you tried so far? What are the obstacles?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is holding you back?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Options&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ask your mentee to think of a few things they could do to reach their goal. Help them to assess each option and to weigh up the options available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What can you do to change the situation?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What are the options to tackle this?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What else might you try?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What one thing would make a real difference&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Who might be able to help?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Which option seems the best? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Way forward&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Establish how committed your mentee is to each of the options they have identified, and which one they will pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You could ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What are the next steps?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What are you going to do?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When/how are your going to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How will this meet your goal?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Who do you need to tell, or consult?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What could get in the way? How can we stop this?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What support do you need? How can you get this?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Five Cs model can be useful to help your mentee to consider all the options that are available to them when considering a complex problem. The framework helps mentees to think about the “Challenges” they face, the “Choices” they have, the “Consequences” of those choice, how they might find “Creative solutions” to the issues and to subsequently draw “Conclusions” about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;75 things to do with your mentees&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Code of conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We expect all our mentors and mentees to conduct themselves professionally and in line with the Civil Service Code – just like any other workplace activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/mentoring-code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; that explains the behaviours and standards you should be able to expect of your mentees, and what they expect of you as mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes margin-top&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to drawing on professional experience of those involved in the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, a number of sources were drawn upon to inform this resource.

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document includes advice, guidance and resources for mentees taking part in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network mentoring programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Separate advice is available for &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/resources-for-mentors&quot;&gt;mentors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;your-role-as-a-mentee&quot;&gt;Your role as a mentee&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-mean-by-mentoring&quot;&gt;What we mean by mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentoring is a relationship between two people: a ‘mentor’ and a ‘mentee’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of mentoring relationship. For the &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, experienced, more senior LGBT+ civil servants mentor less experienced, generally more junior, LGBT+ civil servants like you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the mentoring relationship, your mentors will informally share their knowledge and experience with you to suport your professional and career development. They will coach you to think about how to develop your skills, solve problems, and move your career forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;what-good-looks-like&quot;&gt;What good looks like&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to approach a mentoring relationship. You will need to think about what you want to get out of the relationship you build with your mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a mentee, your mentor will expect you to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be self-aware&lt;/strong&gt; by knowing what you want out of your mentoring relationship, and having a good understanding of your strengths and development needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be communicative&lt;/strong&gt;, with an ability to ‘actively listen’ and to approach conversations in an open, respectful way&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be willing to learn&lt;/strong&gt; by constructively engaging with feedback, and applying knowledge and skills you gain&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be proactive&lt;/strong&gt; by seeking out your own opportunities and bringing issues to explore to your sessions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manage the mentoring relationship&lt;/strong&gt;; mentors are helping you voluntarily and they will expect you to ‘do your bit’ by arranging any engagements and keeping to your commitments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be willing to give feedback&lt;/strong&gt; to your mentor about how your relationship is developing, and what you need more or less of from it&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be trustworthy&lt;/strong&gt; by maintaining the confidentiality of conversations they have with you&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maintain boundaries&lt;/strong&gt; so that the mentoring relationship remains appropriate for the workplace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-having-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Benefits of having a mentor&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finding the right mentor and developing a strong working relationship with them can help to boost your career. As a mentee in the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;, we hope you will be able to things like:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;identify ways to improve your knowledge, skills and expertise&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;plot out your career aspirations and identify ways to get there&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gain insight from more experienced staff&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expand your professional networks across the Civil Service and outside of it&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;build your confidence in engaging with others and improve your communications skills&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use your participation in the programme as evidence of your development as part of your performance management process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your mentor isn’t there to give you all the answers. Mentors can help to provide a framework for you to think through problems, act as a sounding board for your ideas, and provide external challenge that you might not get from someone like your line manager.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-as-part-of-the-programme&quot;&gt;What to do as part of the programme&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;set-up-your-speed-mentoring-sessions&quot;&gt;Set up your speed mentoring sessions&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/mentoring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you will be paired with up to 3 mentors from across the Civil Service. They’ve volunteered to give you a one-off, 30 minute ‘speed mentoring’ session.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is your responsibility to set up the sessions&lt;/strong&gt;. Contact each mentor you are paired with and suggest some times to meet within the next 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The expectation is that the speed mentoring session will either be via phone call or video call. Choose whichever you feel most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you know your work IT doesn’t support video calling, for whatever reason, then consider using a personal device. There are many free services that you can use to make video calls including:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://skype.com&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/facetime/id1110145091&quot;&gt;FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Other video call services are available too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you happen to live in the same area as your mentee, and if it is permitted within the context of the public health guidance at the time, you could also meet face-to-face if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;prepare-for-your-speed-mentoring-sessions&quot;&gt;Prepare for your speed mentoring sessions&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can use your ‘speed mentoring’ sessions however you like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In advance of meeting your mentors, we recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;decide whether you only want some one-off advice or whether you are looking for a mentor long term&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;think about why you signed up to get a mentor, what you hope a mentor can help you with, and be prepared to explain this to your mentor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;be prepared to talk about your career journey so far, and your strengths and development areas that a mentor might be able to help with&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;think about questions you might ask your mentor about their skills, experience and career journey&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;if you want some on-the-spot advice, choose one issue to the meeting to discuss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-with-your-speed-mentors&quot;&gt;Meet with your speed mentors&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Meet with your speed mentors at the times and dates you agreed with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is your responsibility to lead the sessions.&lt;/strong&gt; The point of the programme is to help you get ahead in your career and professional development, so make sure you have thought about what you want to discuss with your speed mentors. They will ask you questions and share their advice; but you need to decide where you want to take the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve told mentors that you might:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;tell them if you want one-off advice or are looking for a  long term mentor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;discuss what you want from a mentoring relationship and what you hope to learn&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;talk about each of your career journeys, skills and experience&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;want to discuss a specific issue to get some on-the-spot advice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;after-youve-completed-your-sessions&quot;&gt;After you’ve completed your sessions&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everyone that signed up to be a mentor has said they would be willing to support one mentee long-term. This usually means continuing to meet with someone roughly every 4 to 8 weeks over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After all your speed mentoring sessions have happened, decide if you want to turn your speed mentoring relationship with one of your mentors into something more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-want-to-keep-one-of-your-mentors&quot;&gt;If you want to keep one of your mentors&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If one or more of the mentors you met really stood out as someone you’d like to keep meeting with, &lt;strong&gt;it is your responsibility to approach a mentor and to keep the relationship going&lt;/strong&gt;. We would recommend you meet with your mentor once every 4 to 8 weeks for up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should contact your preferred mentor as soon as possible to ask them if they’d be happy to continue meeting with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Please only approach one mentor at a time so that as many mentees as possible get a chance to build that long-term relationship with a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are resources below to support you to continue the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-dont-want-to-keep-any-of-your-mentors&quot;&gt;If you don’t want to keep any of your mentors&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If your mentors weren’t the right fit for you or you just don’t want to continue your relationship with any of them, then that’s the end of the programme: at least for you, for this round.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We hope you were able to get some benefit from the speed mentoring sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Code of conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We expect all our mentors and mentees to conduct themselves professionally and in line with the Civil Service Code – just like any other workplace activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/mentoring-code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; that explains the behaviours and standards you should be able to expect of your mentors, and what they expect of you as mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document explains the standards of behaviour and conduct we expect of all participants in the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;focus&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The focus of the discussions between a mentor and mentee should be on issues related to their professional and career development.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentees should be clear about their priorities and what they need from their mentors. Mentors should be responsive to those needs, and should not impose their own agenda or priorities on their mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;general-behaviours&quot;&gt;General behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees will be open and truthful with themselves, and each other whilst participating in the mentoring relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees will respect each other’s time and other responsibilities, ensuring they do not impose beyond what is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The mentee will increasingly be responsible for managing their mentoring relationship; the mentor will empower them to do so and will promote the mentee’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;boundaries&quot;&gt;Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors should never work beyond the bounds of their capability, experience and expertise to the point where they do not feel confident in providing the mentee with proper support. Where appropriate, mentors should seek advice or refer mentees to another more appropriate point of contact. This might be to refer the mentee to professional contacts or support services.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees should conduct their relationship in the same way that they would in any other work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees will not intrude into areas either wishes to keep private until invited to do so. Mentors should, however, help the mentee to recognise how other issues may relate to these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees may develop friendships over time. It is important to have a clear, professional, relationship so as to not allow personal bias to influence professional actions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;confidentiality&quot;&gt;Confidentiality&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees will share information, advice and their experience with each during the course of their relationship. Some of this information might not be intended to be shared. Mentors and mentees should agree whether or not their conversations are kept confidential.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;propriety&quot;&gt;Propriety&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors and mentees have a responsibility to disclose to each other any conflicts of interest that may arise during a mentoring relationship at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;ending-the-relationship&quot;&gt;Ending the relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Either the mentor or the mentee can ask to end the relationship at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mentors will share the responsibility for the smooth winding down of the relationship with the mentee, once it has achieved its purpose – they must avoid creating dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns-and-complaints&quot;&gt;Concerns and complaints&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a mentor or mentee has a concern about the conduct of their partner on this programme, then they should raise this with them directly in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If, after raising this with them, a mentor or mentee still has concerns, they should seek to raise this via their usual departmental complaints procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/07/08/standards-of-behaviour-why-we-ve-set-them">&lt;p&gt;For reasons that won’t have escaped anyone we’ve been doing more events online over the last year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online events are brilliant levellers in many ways. They’ve allowed us to run events when we want to, not just when we can book a room large enough. We’ve been able to open them up to more people, across more organisations and from across the UK (and probably the world but we don’t actually keep track!). They’ve enabled more people to access events from a practical perspective too; you no longer have to trek down Whitehall or across your hub to get to a 45 minute event at lunchtime.  Now you can fit it in between back to back meetings or alongside your lunch break; whatever works for your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this way of doing things is better than what we did before. More people can benefit because more people can take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly it isn’t all positives though. Events that we attend remotely can bring out our inner keyboard warrior. Where we aren’t interacting in a room, it’s easier to lose sight of how our comments can affect other people. We want to make sure that this isn’t a trap that we as a network fall into, and we want to be clear that we expect everyone engaging with our network to treat each other with respect, regardless of any differences in identity, life experience or beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help to do this, we’ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/standards-of-behaviour&quot;&gt;Standards of Behaviour&lt;/a&gt; statement. The statement is our way of making it clear what is, and what is not, acceptable behaviour at our events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our network exists to make sure everyone can come to work each day feeling safe to be themselves. We hope that you will all agree with us that this makes it easier and clearer for everyone to know what we expect so we can achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/07/05/why-you-should-consider-mentoring" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Anyone can become a mentor" />
			<published>2021-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2021-07-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/07/05/anyone-can-become-a-mentor</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/07/05/why-you-should-consider-mentoring">&lt;p&gt;As soon as the LGBT+ network mentoring programme was announced, I knew I wanted to get involved because I’ve benefited so much from mentoring in different ways throughout my career: not just traditional sessions with a senior mentor, but also peer mentoring through an Action Learning Set, and my own experience becoming a mentor to a final year student at my old university last year. If you’ve been thinking of signing up as a mentor but don’t know if you’ve got the right experience,I can’t say strongly enough that you won’t know how much you have to offer until you try it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to remember is that your role as a mentor is all about helping your mentee realise their own potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might look like coaching them to find their own solutions, building up your mentee’s confidence in their own judgement or offering a new perspective on a situation. There are times when your mentee might want direct advice or feedback - for example, reviewing a job application - but there’s all sorts of experience you might have that another person is hoping to learn from, whether it’s flexible working, the profession you work in, line management, taking on a corporate role. The possibilities are endless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience the only definite criteria needed to be a good mentor are two things someone who can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;impartial, in that you’re not directly involved in your mentee’s day-to-day work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in your mentee’s ‘corner’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re able to do both those things, there’s sure to be someone out there who’ll benefit from your commitment, and you’ll benefit too. From being on both sides of the relationship I’ve realised that both having and being a mentor really helps you develop as a problem-solver, as well as building your confidence and leadership abilities. Of all the achievements I’ve had at work over the last year or so, none of them has made me feel prouder than supporting my mentee to get her first graduate job in the Civil Service in such a challenging year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also helped me get past some of my stubbornness over asking for help. Realising how much I looked forward to hearing from my mentee and how I always managed to make time for her has helped me to ignore the voice in the back of my head that tells me that “they’ll be much too busy, it’ll be annoying” when I’m about to press send on an email asking for a second opinion on a tricky problem at work. Becoming a mentor is what actually gave me the confidence to reach out to my own SCS mentor, which has helped me hugely in the last few months as I’ve got to grips with moving into a new role and department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all of this might have sold you on the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;mentoring&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/register-as-a-mentee&quot;&gt;signing up for a mentor&lt;/a&gt;) in general, but I also wanted to put in a quick word for why it’s so important that the LGBT+ network is putting together its own scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at the heart of a mentoring relationship is mutual respect and the ability to be honest with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said, that can come from a place of similar or totally different life and career experiences, but without it the relationship won’t flourish. The LGBT+ network is all about solidarity and support that recognises how diverse our identities and experiences are - and I hope the mentoring scheme will give everyone who needs it the confidence to sign up knowing that respect and space to be yourself will be built into the relationship from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network exists to ensure that every one can come to work each day feeling safe to be themselves. We do not want anyone to experience, or be in fear of experiencing, discrimination because they have a minority sexual orientation or gender identity. We believe that people will be more effective if they can be themselves at work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We also want to help make the Civil Service the most inclusive employer in the United Kingdom. We want to encourage a culture that supports workplace equality and engages with LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From time to time, the network organises events. Consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/mission-statement/&quot;&gt;our mission statement and objectives&lt;/a&gt;, these events can include learning and development events, social and networking events.
Most of our events are open to everyone in the Civil Service – regardless of who they are, or how they identify. Some events are designed to provide a space for specific groups of people to come together, like our women’s events and BiSpace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For all our events, we aim to ensure that everyone will be welcomed and feel included. We expect everyone attending our events to uphold the highest standards of behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-code&quot;&gt;Civil Service Code&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All civil servants – regardless of their role or grade – are bound by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code&quot;&gt;Civil Service Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We expect everyone attending one of our events to abide by the core Civil Service values of ‘integrity’, ‘honesty’, ‘objectivity’ and ‘impartiality’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In particular, we expect that anyone attending our events will always act in a way that:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;is professional&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;is fair, just and equitable&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reflects the Civil Service commitment to equality and diversity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;maintains political impartiality, no matter what their own political beliefs are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;general-conduct&quot;&gt;General conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We consider the events we organise to be an extension of your workplace. We expect that everyone attending our events holds themselves to the same standards as they would in their ordinary place of work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If your conduct is not suitable for your workplace, we also consider it to be unsuitable at our events.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;use-of-language&quot;&gt;Use of language&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You will hear and read lots of terminology used on our website, in our communications materials, and at our events.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our ambition is to use language that is clear and accessible so it is widely understood by as many people as possible. We also understand that seeing or hearing terms you might personally identify with is important.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In general, we use the term ‘LGBT+’ to describe all people with minority sexual orientations, gender identities or expressions, or variations in sex characteristics. You may, from time to time, hear us use terms like:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gay, lesbian, bi, ace or queer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;heterosexual or straight&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;transgender, non-binary or cisgender&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;intersex&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some of these terms are well understood; others are not. If we use a particular term, we mean it in the broadest, most inclusive way possible. For example, when we talk about ‘bi’ people, we usually mean that term to include bisexual, pansexual and asexual people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We recognise that some of these terms might make you feel uncomfortable. We will always aim to use language sensitively. The words we choose will never be intended to cause offense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We expect that everyone attending one of our events will also choose their words carefully and sensitively.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;responding-to-issues-and-managing-complaints&quot;&gt;Responding to issues and managing complaints&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If we consider the conduct of someone attending our events to fall below the standards we have set out in this document, we reserve the right to take action in response.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our response will be proportionate to the significance of the issues at hand. We will ordinarily:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a first step, ask that attendees stop conducting themselves in the manner that they are&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;if this does not help to resolve a situation, we may eject attendees from an event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In light of the severity of an issue, we may also:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;refuse to admit individuals to future events for a period of time or indefinitely&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;formally escalate an issue internal to the attendees’ department or agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Individuals affected will have a right to appeal a decision retrospectively, either via the Network’s leadership team or, where formal processes are engaged, through usual departmental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/06/14/give-something-back-become-an-lgbt-mentor">&lt;p&gt;Last week, registrations opened for our new LGBT+ mentoring programme. We’re aiming to match junior mentees to more senior mentors; initially for ‘speed mentoring’ and in the hope people make those relationships more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response has been brilliant so far. More than 300 people have stepped forward to say they want to either be a mentee, mentor or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been leading the work to develop this new programme. It’s something the Network has wanted to set up for a long time. I wanted to share my reflections on why I decided to pick up this work and why we’ve done it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-mentoring&quot;&gt;Why mentoring?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s personal. I was inspired to step up and lead this project because I’ve seen first hand how beneficial it can be for mentors and mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I started volunteering for the LGBT+ youth charity, &lt;a href=&quot;//justlikeus.org&quot;&gt;Just Like Us&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to give something back to the next generation of LGBT+ people that wasn’t just part of my day job. I have gotten to mentor a recent entrant to the Civil Service and help them on their first steps in their public sector career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been able to do my bit as the village elder for them. They’ve taught me lots about how being new to the the Civil Service feels when you’re joining in the middle of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And being a mentor has stretched my skills. I’ve been managing teams for several years now; but the skills you need to lead a team are different to those you need when coaching someone to find their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a useful learning experience for me (and I hope for them too!). So useful that I think everyone should give something back and be a mentor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a mentoring programme is something the Network has been trying to do for years. Way back in 2011, research commissioned by the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance (the predecessor to this LGBT+ Network) showed that development opportunities were lacking for LGBT+ civil servants. Until now, it wasn’t practical to try to set one up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has changed that. It’s changed the ways the Civil Service engages with itself. Making a mentoring programme work a few years ago would have meant worrying about where people worked as much as what experience they had. Now, the only thing we need to worry about is whether people have a good-enough internet connection for a video call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was ever a moment we could all make this work, we think now is it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still going to be a big logistics exercise to make this programme work – and we’re only at the start – but we’ve got a good plan and we think that our new ways of working are going to make this great for both mentors and mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/twitter-timeline-4--give-something-back.png&quot; alt=&quot;Give something back. Become an LGBT+ mentor.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-something-back&quot;&gt;Give something back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we’ve done it, and why we’ve done it now. Now it’s up to you! You should ‘give something back’ too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Become an LGBT+ mentor. It’ll help someone else and it’ll help to develop you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;register as an LGBT+ mentor&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the programme now until the 31 July 2021, and &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/about-our-mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;find out more about the programme&lt;/a&gt; on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These are email templates for use by mentees who feel less confident approaching their mentors as part of the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;speed-mentoring-email-template&quot;&gt;Speed mentoring email template&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This email template is for when you’re initially contacting your mentors to arrange your speed mentoring sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi [name of your mentor],&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m [your name]. I registered for the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme and you have been matched with me as a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To briefly introduce myself, I am a [your grade and role], working for [your department or agency].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to arrange our speed mentoring session. I would be available to talk at the following times:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;[insert a few dates and times you might be able to meet]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Would any of these times work for you?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I understand these sessions are meant to be conducted via video call. I would prefer to use [Microsoft Teams / Zoom / Google Meet], if that would work for you?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once you have confirmed a time, I would be happy to set up the video call and send you a calendar invite.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[your name]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-mentoring-email-template&quot;&gt;Long term mentoring email template&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This email template is for after you have completed your speed mentoring, and you want to approach one of your speed mentors to be your long-term mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi [name of your chosen mentor],&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time during our speed mentoring session on [date of your speed mentoring session].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I found our speed mentoring session very useful. [Explain why you found the session useful].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now that I have met with all the speed mentors I was matched with on the programme, I would like to ask you if you would be willing to be my mentor long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I feel that you would be able to help me to [explain what areas you are looking to develop]. I think you could help me to develop in this way in particular because [explain the particular skills, experience or background that your prospective mentor has].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you think you would be able to help me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[your name]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This publication provides general information about the Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s mentoring programme, including eligibitly, how to become a mentor and a mentee, and what resources and support are available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/twitter-timeline--mentoring-for-lgbt-civil-servants.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registrations for the 2021 programme have now closed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you registered as either a mentee or mentor before the deadline, we will contact you soon via email with your matches. If you have not heard from us by 1 September 2021, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;mentoring@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt; and we will check the status of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-programme&quot;&gt;About the programme&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/publication/2011/10/01/career-development-for-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-civil-servants&quot;&gt;Research into the career progression of LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/a&gt; conducted by our predecessor network, the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance, found that respondents felt they didn’t have access to the same career opportunities – and particularly development opportunities – as their straight or cisgendered counterparts. We know that access to mentoring is one of the things you have consistently asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have created the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt; to provide LGBT+ people working in the Civil Service access to mentors who are also LGBT+ and working in more senior roles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The programme is run entirely online, so anyone can take part no matter who you are, where you live or where you are in your career journey.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;who-the-programme-is-for&quot;&gt;Who the programme is for&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt; is open to all staff who have a minority sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or have variations in sex characteristics (LGBT+). Participation is voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;who-can-be-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Who can be a mentor&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anyone can be a mentor. We ask that mentors identify as LGBT+.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what grade you are, what profession you work in, or where you are based. We will generally try to match mentors to mentees who are one or two grades more junior than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will give all mentors access to induction and guidance on how to be effective in their role as a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage people at all grades to sign up as mentors – whether you’re an SCS or an AO. Everyone can help someone! The more mentors we have, the more mentees we can support through the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Register as a mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;who-can-be-a-mentee&quot;&gt;Who can be a mentee&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anyone can be a mentee. The scheme is aimed at people who identify as LGBT+.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’re a mentee, we’ll be aiming to match you to mentors that are one or two grades more senior than you are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whilst we can’t guarantee that everyone will find a mentor they keep for the long term, we will try to ensure everyone can access a speed mentoring session as part of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentee&quot;&gt;Register as a mentee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;register-your-interest&quot;&gt;1. Register your interest&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can register as a mentor, a mentee, or both. You can register online using these forms:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;register as a mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentee&quot;&gt;register as a mentee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of the registration process you will be asked to provide information including:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your name&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your contact details&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;your current grade, profession, and department&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will use this information to match up potential mentors and mentees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We only accept new registrations for the programme at certain points of the year. We will publish information our website when the application window is open.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;wait-for-your-potential-matches&quot;&gt;2. Wait for your potential matches&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After you have registered and after the registration window has closed, we will:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;invite you to an induction event&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;email you with several potential matches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Each mentor and mentee will be given up to 3 matches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It may take several weeks to find a suitable match for you. Please be patient. If we are unable to find a potential match, we will contact you to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;set-up-a-speed-mentoring-session&quot;&gt;3. Set up a ‘speed mentoring’ session&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once you have received your matches, if you are a:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mentee&lt;/strong&gt;, you should contact each mentor you are matched with to arrange a 30 minute ‘speed mentoring’ session&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mentor&lt;/strong&gt;, you should wait to be contacted by each mentee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should use the speed mentoring session to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;exchange quick advice on topics relevant to your career or development&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;decide if you would like to continue your mentoring relationship beyond that one-off session&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-the-conversation-going&quot;&gt;4. Keep the conversation going&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you agreed to meet your mentor or mentee again, it is your responsibility to keep the relationship going. It is up to you to decide how it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can meet with each other as little or as often as you both like, and it’s up to you how long the relationship lasts. We would usually expect mentors and mentees to meet every 4 to 8 weeks for up to 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will publish and send guidance to you about how to make the most of your mentoring relationship during the first 3 months after you match.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that not everyone will find a mentoring relationship they are willing or able to maintain long term. That is why we are using a ‘speed mentoring’ format, so that everyone that takes part gets something from the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;How to get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;become-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Become a mentor&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/twitter-timeline--become-a-mentor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give something back and become an LGBT+ mentor.&lt;/strong&gt; Acting as a mentor can help other, less experienced staff get on with their career. It can be a rewarding experience for you too; you can learn new skills and it makes a great corporate contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a mentor, you’ll be asked to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet with up to 3 mentees for ‘speed mentoring’.&lt;/strong&gt; You will be asked to meet for one, 30 minute session with each mentee. They will contact you to arrange a suitable time and date.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agree to mentor at least one longer-term mentee.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you have met all your mentees, we’d ask that you agree to keep meeting at least one of them to provide them with a mentoring relationship on an ongoing basis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a mentor, you can expect to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;be matched with someone one or two grades more junior to you&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;be offered a short induction session for new mentors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;receive published guidance on how to maximise your role as a mentor&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;have the chance to join a network of other mentors who you can speak to for advice too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Register as a mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give your career a boost and sign up as a mentee.&lt;/strong&gt; The right mentor can help you to refine your career goals, identify opportunities for development and build your networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a mentee, you’ll be asked to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up ‘speed mentoring’ sessions with each mentor we match you with.&lt;/strong&gt; It is your responsibility to arrange a suitable time and date. You should meet each mentor for an initial 30 minute session.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide if you want to keep a mentor.&lt;/strong&gt; If you feel you can learn something from one of the mentors you meet, ask them if they can be your mentor long-term.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead your relationship with your mentor.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are successful in securing a long-term mentor, it’s your responsibility to organise meetings and lead your relationship with them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a mentee, you can expect to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;be offered a short induction session for new mentees&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;receive published guidance on how to maximise your role as a mentee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;resources-and-support&quot;&gt;Resources and support&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have produced the following resources for those participating in the programme:&lt;/p&gt;

			<updated>2021-06-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2021/06/07/mentoring-programme/">&lt;p&gt;Today we’re launching a new mentoring programme aimed at LGBT+ civil servants. We’re asking you – whatever your grade, location, department or LGBT+ identity – to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-were-creating-a-mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;Why we’re creating a mentoring programme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research into the career progression of LGBT+ civil servants conducted by our predecessor network, the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance, found that respondents felt they didn’t have access to the same career opportunities – and particularly development opportunities – as their straight or cisgendered counterparts. We know that access to mentoring is one of the things you have consistently asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re setting up a mentoring programme to help plug that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that it will be totally online. That means no matter who you are, where you live or where you are in your career journey, you can take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-will-work&quot;&gt;How it will work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new mentoring programme will match mentees to more senior or experienced mentors. All the mentees and mentors will be LGBT+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-sign-up-as-a-mentor-or-mentee&quot;&gt;1. Sign up as a mentor or mentee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be able to register as a mentor, a mentee, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll ask you to provide us with some information about you; like your Civil Service profession and your grade. We’ll use this information to narrow down mentors and mentees we think might be a good match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can be a mentor. It doesn’t matter what grade you are, what profession you work in, or where you’re based. We’ll give you training and guidance on how to be an effective mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a mentee, we’ll be aiming to match you to mentors that are one or two grades more senior than you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-wait-for-your-matches&quot;&gt;2. Wait for your matches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve registered your interest, we’ll send mentees and mentors up to 3 matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-set-up-a-speed-mentoring-session&quot;&gt;3. Set up a ‘speed mentoring’ session&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve sent out the matches, mentees are responsible for contacting their matched mentors to arrange a one-off, 30 minute mentoring session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both the mentor and mentee decide they’re a good match, they can agree to keep the relationship going and to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-keep-the-conversation-going&quot;&gt;4. Keep the conversation going&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/website-explainer-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve found a match, the rest is up to you! You can meet up with your mentor or mentee as often as you both agree to meet. We’ll send you regular reminders, tips and advice about how to get the most from your mentoring relationship over the following months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t match with someone then you can submit yourself to the next round of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Read &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/about-our-mentoring-programme&quot;&gt;about the mentoring programme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-next&quot;&gt;What to do next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in taking part, the first step is to sign up. You can sign up as both a mentor and a mentee if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Registratons for the first round of the programme are open from 7 June 2021 to 31 July 2021.
We will start matching mentors and mentees after the registration window has closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;become-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Become a mentor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/mentoring-scheme/twitter-timeline--become-a-mentor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give something back and become an LGBT+ mentor. We strongly encourage people at all grades to sign up as mentors – whether you’re an SCS or an EO. Everyone can help someone! The more mentors we have, the more mentees we can support through the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentor&quot;&gt;Register as a mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your career a boost and sign up as a mentee. Whilst we can’t guarantee that everyone will find a mentor they keep for the long term, we will try to ensure everyone can access some speed mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/register-as-a-mentee&quot;&gt;Register as a mentee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<updated>2021-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/05/17/idahobit-2021-wave-your-rainbow-flag-high-</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/05/17/idahobit-2021-wave-your-rainbow-flag-high-">&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-sarah-a-policy-officer-at-dhsc&quot;&gt;From Sarah, a Policy Officer at DHSC.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wave your rainbow flag high! 17 May is (by coincidence the 17th) International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The date commemorates the World Health Organisation’s declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder on 17 May 1990. Darkly amusing fact: in 1979, many Swedish people called in sick with a ‘case of being homosexual’, in protest of its classification as an illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDAHOBIT serves as an important annual reminder that there’s still a very mixed picture of progress made in the global fight for LGBT+ equality. For example, it’s still illegal to be gay in at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://76crimes.com/76-countries-where-homosexuality-is-illegal/&quot;&gt;71 countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often hear people question the need for days such as IDAHOBIT in places such as the UK when (they say) equal rights have been won. However, legal progress is no guarantee of social progress: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.galop.org.uk/transphobic-hate-crime-report-2020/&quot;&gt;prejudice, bullying, discrimination and violence against LGBT+ people persists&lt;/a&gt; despite legal protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stress that LGBT+ discrimination doesn’t just include things like being ineligible for joining the army because of your gender identity, or being attacked because of your sexuality. It also includes more subtle behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a gay person, I’ve had experience of this first-hand. Being stared at for holding hands with a partner, for example, made a small action others take for granted something quite uncomfortable. Being assumed to have a partner of a different sex has forced me into either ‘outing’ myself, or continuing in a conversation where my identity is erased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, nothing under the LGBT+ umbrella was mentioned at home, in the media, or at school. Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act prohibited the so-called ‘promotion of homosexuality’ and ‘teaching of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship’ in local authority schools. This is another kind of discrimination: the denial of the right to talk about your identity or to find someone to relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Section 28 was abolished in 2003, this came too late for me. I remember one teacher telling me not to say any more, as it ‘might get her in trouble’, when I mustered the courage to speak to her about my sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paled in comparison to the extremely hostile reaction I had from my parents though, which made my home life extremely difficult before going away to university. Because of this, I’ve been conscious throughout the pandemic of the hostility young people locked down with unaccepting families might be experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in the UK in the last two decades. There have been many legal reforms, and it’s increasingly socially unacceptable – although not everywhere – to be homophobic, biphobic and transphobic. I know that while I was thrown out of bars for kissing someone in my teens, this would be less likely to happen now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we should bear some things in mind. Firstly, even if discriminatory behaviour goes away, experiences of it have long-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, laws can come and go according to the agendas of different administrations; rights are still there to be fought for and won overseas; and sexual and gender minorities are still suffering – even here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While celebrating how far we’ve come, then, IDAHOBIT should also remind us how far we still have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-to-help&quot;&gt;What can you do to help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small words and actions can make a big difference to the wellbeing of others. To show solidarity and encourage inclusivity you could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider including your pronouns in your email signature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use more inclusive language, such as saying ‘welcome all’ to mixed gender groups rather than ‘welcome ladies and gentlemen’, and avoid making assumptions about someone’s gender identity or sexuality&lt;/li&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/05/17/idahobit-2021-steph-vice-chair-a-gender-">&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-steph-vice-chair-of-the-agender-staff-network&quot;&gt;From Steph, Vice Chair of the A:GENDER staff network.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be using a particular word in this piece, because it is the word that has been used on me for decades, and one that is steadily being reclaimed. That word is ‘Queer’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the word shouted at me as I was beaten up at school, which was almost every day, and the word used in the streets when it continued as an after-curriculum club. It was the word used by the nice man who attacked me a couple of years ago in Birmingham. It was one of the words used by the four men who attacked me at work, as they slapped me, spat on me, verbally abused me and filmed the whole process. It is a word with a weight of hatred, but one which queer people are reclaiming for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reclamation is one of the brighter aspects of hate—there has to be a silver lining, even if we make it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned from each such incident has changed over the years. When I was a child and then into my teens, as the hate combined with my dysphoria, the lesson I learned was that killing myself was an attractive option. That is sadly a view taken by all too many LGBT+ youth, and the only good thing that came out of it for me was that despite my efforts I was not actually very good at it. It took many more years before I realised that the attraction is a false one, but in the meantime, the fall-out on my family, as well as on medical staff, must have been dreadful. Drop a stone into a millpond, and the ripples spread, as John Donne observed: none of us is an island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was attacked at work, the impact on my team was profound, as was their effect on me. They saw a friend, broken and shaking, and they put aside their other issues to pick me up and restore my balance, perhaps some of my sanity. When I was attacked in Birmingham, I walked into a group of friends from a:gender who did exactly the same. At the time, my focus was all on me, but once I was able to think more clearly, I could see there were deep wounds in their own souls. Ripples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with my colleagues in Spectrum, we took the attack at work and turned it round. A short stage play at a conference, using trans actors, has resulted in one of them, a trans man called Ash, using the recording as part of his CV to gain a continuing role in a major soap, Emmerdale, where he plays a trans man, not only recognising his validity but celebrating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham incident is now part of our toolkit of examples for a:gender awareness events, where the reaction from delegates is something that we so often miss as we recover from the slaps, the blows, the spitting, the shouts of “Queer!”: hatred affects all of us as fellow humans, emphasises that hatred remains a minority pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are recovering that word, and we can use the hatred that drives it against itself, because once it is brought out into the light, it withers. That is what all of us can do, whether or not we are a part of the LGBT+ rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parting words of that man in Birmingham were “What sort of &lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;** queer are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the sort with friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2021/05/04/we-re-keeping-prideon-again/">&lt;p&gt;The anniversary of the Stonewall riots, and the start of pride season, is right around the corner. That means it’s almost time for our annual season of events to kick off inside the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; took pride online. We led the Civil Service’s first ever, all digital pride season. Hundreds of people took part, meaning we could all still commemorate and celebrate despite the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, things look brighter and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to restart some of our in-person events and socials across the UK soon. But we thought last year’s pride activities were pretty great! We were thrilled to have the work of our network of volunteers recognised as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/12/10/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Awards-2020&quot;&gt;Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards&lt;/a&gt;. We want to build on what we learnt from last year. That’s why we’re keeping Pride On, again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pride 2021, we’ll be putting on a new season of events and encouraging you to take part in pride online. We’ve got lots of ideas to make this year’s PrideOn bigger, better, and prouder than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-can-i-find-out-whats-planned&quot;&gt;Where can I find out what’s planned?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/pride-2021/&quot;&gt;#PrideOn page&lt;/a&gt; on our website. We’ll be adding all the details of our upcoming events and activities there in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-help&quot;&gt;How can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to help us put #PrideOn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpy4PZmVTkzexU0wKcnrswQMzWGThR-pusrB3kYglNFfo9bQ/viewform&quot;&gt;register your interest&lt;/a&gt; by 5 May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-pride-marches-and-parades&quot;&gt;What about pride marches and parades?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In consultation with the chairs of departmental LGBT+ networks and departmental LGBT+ champions, we have decided to focus our efforts on PrideOn this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is a big undertaking to organise for us, and we want to get it right. We won’t be centrally coordinating attendance at physical pride marches or parades in 2021. We hope to be a bit more back-to-normal for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/04/26/its-important-that-im-visible-as-a-lesbian-in-a-leadership-role">&lt;p&gt;I’m Pippa and I’m a statistician at the Department for Education, leading a unit of around 25 analysts supporting early years and deprivation policy. I joined DfE in 2016 having spent the first 12 years of my career at Defra. I’m a lesbian, a mother and a fiancée. I should be a wife by now, but Covid has put paid to that for a while. I have a cat (obviously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out at 17 and had very supportive family and friends who never made my sexuality a problem. I know this makes me lucky, and it’s what’s helped me feel able to be ‘out’ at work ever since I joined the Civil Service in 2004. It’s easy to forget this was before the Civil Partnership Act came into effect – so before same-sex relationships were legally recognised. In any case, throughout my career I’ve found colleagues to be nothing but accepting and supportive of my sexuality and family life. Occasionally people have assumed I have a male partner – usually relating to the fact that I have a 4-year-old daughter – but when I set them straight (so to speak) they apologise and we move on, no harm done. I know for some LGBT+ people this can be really difficult so I do call it out when it happens, but I try not to make it awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very open about my life, partner and family with my teams and colleagues. I like sharing stories about my personal life as part of my authentic leadership style, and I like finding out more about the people I work with. But it’s also really important to me that I’m visible as a lesbian in a leadership role, and to play my part in creating a diverse and inclusive Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy lesbian visibility week!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/04/26/a-focus-on-gender-based-violence-this-lesbian-visibility-week">&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am Leah Cunnah, one of the vice-chairs. I lead on our work around allyship and women in the network. I want to do more to deliver resources and events for LGBT+ women to increase support and interest as well as to increase inclusion and diversity in the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cisgender and heterosexual women, I have felt fear walking home at night. I have carried keys between my fingers for protection. I have called home as I thought I was being followed. I have received inappropriate comments and stares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures on physical, verbal and emotional violence against women are shocking, but they worsen and widen when we consider intersectional factors such as identifying as LGBT+. As well as women, I fear for people who are not cisgender or heterosexual. My concern is for my LGBT+ friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT+ people should be able to live their lives without fear of homophobia, biphobia or transphobia. Equally, people’s physical or mental wellbeing should not be at risk due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worry for LGBT+ women, as the intersectionality of sex, sexuality and gender worsens and increases the inequality they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worry for my trans and non-binary friends. As when someone transitions or presents in a non-binary way, they can lose male privileges and advantages, while gaining new oppressions and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worry for LGBT+ men. Trans men do not have the same privileges as cisgender men, nor do gay or bisexual men have the same advantages as a heterosexual man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may feel safer as a woman within company rather than alone. However, my LGBT+ friends can feel scared both when they are alone and in company. They often can’t enjoy being with their same-sex partner or with a group of LGBT+ friends without fear of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may feel safer in the daytime rather than night-time. However, my LGBT+ friends still face the risk of abuse in public and day light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can walk down the street holding my partners hand without a second thought. Many of my LGBT+ friends cannot do this without fear of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel safe and secure at home. For some of my LGBT+ friends they don’t even feel safe in their own homes. They can be at the risk of violence from their own friends, family members of partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people who are not part of the LGBT+ community are not aware of these issues so the Civil Service LGBT+ Network wish to produce guidance to help others to understand LGBT+ people’s experiences of gender-based violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start this project, we would like to invite LGBT+ women from across the Civil Service to join us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2021/04/28/civil-service-lgbt-women-s-event&quot;&gt;Wednesday 28th April from 12.30 – 13.30&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to talk about this topic and to get involved for Lesbian Visibility Week. Sign up details are available via our events page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will hold future workshop events to discuss gender-based violence to gain an insight into your experiences and to find out what you would like to see in the guidance. If you would like to get involved, then please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;In celebration of International Women’s Day - 8th March 2021, as a proud LGBT woman I am here to share some of my experiences…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a scientific background, working in the forensic service industry and I joined the civil service in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting my career outside the civil service, and as a lesbian woman – it began rather differently to most. In my first role, our business unit director was a woman, who was openly gay. At the same time, my immediate line manager was also a proud LGBT woman! In any workplace I think you’d agree that was a rarity, which I might never experience again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so important and impactful for me to see this early on in my career. To be surrounded by relatable, female professional role models who later became mentors was a great chapter. I progressed quickly in my role and always felt supported at work. I successfully gained a promotion with management responsibility and in time, was involved in recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then applied for a civil service role and I remember as I walked in to meet the panel for my current role, one of the interviewers was wearing a rainbow lanyard. It put me at ease straight away! So, my first impression of LGBT+ support within the civil service was positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my positive start, I do echo the experiences of many LGBT+ people in recent virtual events who spoke of having to continually ‘come out’ at work. I wouldn’t say it is ever 100% easy (especially if you’re single) and there is a fear of hostility, or fear of changes in how people interact with you. My experiences throughout my career have been positive though, and I would say that helps me to feel comfortable at work. There are heteronormative assumptions made, and I have had assumptions made about my sexual orientation at work. This is a wider societal issue and is it changing. But however sad, I do still expect these assumptions at work and I tend to correct them straight away, but always in a friendly way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my current role, I champion and share LGBT+ resources to provide material for my immediate team to engage with. Last year for Pride month I also helped to launch an internal Pride email signature with options for allies, and LGBT members. These changes were all positively met when pitched to management, which is always lovely and reassuring! I think as a member of the LGBT+ community, it’s important to lead the way in this space and allow others the chance to be an ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, small efforts like an email signature are a simple solution to visibility and can go a long way towards helping others feel comfortable at work. For me, it invited friendly discussions and helped to identify other LGBT+ members. Generally, I have always found social settings or forums the easiest way to come out at work (whether it’s telling one, two or ten people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the privilege of working in diverse and open working environments. In my current role, I generally work with teams that are balanced by gender, age and previous experience. Since joining the civil service, I do see gender balance at executive officer / higher officer level and have not personally experienced any barriers to my own progression by being an LGBT woman. I have also recently been successful in obtaining a new post in another government department - and I look forward to ‘coming out’ all over again in my new role!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise gender balance at lower levels and female representation is increasing across senior levels. However, women still only occupy 43% of roles at the most senior level in the civil service. For me, that is something that needs to be further addressed if I am to believe the highest levels of the career ladder are open to both men and women equally, in all branches of the Civil Service. In my previous industry, I was surrounded by female leaders so in that sense, there has been a contrast since joining the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been occasions in role within my current role in the civil service where I was acutely aware that I was one of few women in the room. However, I think it’s important to emphasise that I was in that meeting, with a seat at the table. I was afforded the same opportunity to contribute as others in the room and most crucially, I did contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always mindful that years before me, a woman will have entered many rooms I am now invited to walk into - and paved a way forward. Even if it were the case that a woman had never spoken up in a meeting before I did, or never held a title before I did… I believe we should relish the opportunity to be the first. As that is effectively, shattering the glass ceiling (whether it’s double-glazed or not)! I try to see opportunities, not barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the goal now is to keep pushing on… gaining experience and setting new career aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within my lifetime we have seen legislative changes aiming to extend the protection of LGBT people and promote equality, and these are important progressions. I’ve also grown up with the social movements, shifts and the growing culture of speaking out against discrimination that plays into my own stance. I do believe there’s a lot more work to be done to achieve gender equality within the civil service, and to educate people on fascinating LGBT+ history. Without the backstory, you cannot appreciate the level and forms of discrimination LGBT+ people face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lesbian woman, I am very fortunate to continue to have a great support network - including supportive family, friends and colleagues. This support undoubtedly gives me confidence to be myself in all aspects of my life. Groups like the civil service LGBT+ network are so important, and the range of events is very positive to see!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Hello! Happy International Women’s Day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Lucy Rylott and I am an OD Caseworker for the CPS. Embarking on a career in the civil service as an LGBT+ woman can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting as an apprentice, I felt as though I was ground level worker in the organisation with the additional pressure of having to come out to my colleagues to be my authentic self. I found using more inclusive language such as my ‘partner’ helped me ease into telling my colleagues about my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, I brought a picture of us both and put it on my desk just to make the topic seem less alien. Although I was nervous at the time, I was welcomes with open arms and supported completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had come out to my colleagues, I felt more confident to join the LGBT+ Network as an open member, only to find that it is extremely male dominated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experiences with this Network have all been positive but I sometimes feel like I am the only LGBT+ woman that attends any meetings at all! There are multiple female Allies which are always appreciated and welcomed, but to still feel like an outsider in a community I am part of is a very humbling feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it is simply a lack of LGBT+ women within the organisation, or if there is something wider with LGBT+ women not being confident enough to join the network. Either way, this is something I would love to see change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see more LGBT+ women in the network even just to feel that comfort of knowing there is someone else there that understands you and your struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disparity in the struggles of LGBT+ men and LGBT+ women go through is something that can feel quite isolating at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal would be to have a wider outreach to LGBT+ women in the organisation and encourage them to get involved with important work that goes on in the community to make sure that the women’s side is considered too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">Simon Bowkett: a short blog in Polari for LGBT+ History Month</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2021/02/24/polari-history-month" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simon Bowkett: a short blog in Polari for LGBT+ History Month" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2021/02/24/polari-history-month">&lt;p&gt;Simon Bowkett, from MHCLG has wrritten a short blog in Polari for LGBT+ Hisotry Month - can you guess what it says?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boyno-duckies&quot;&gt;Boyno, Duckies!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you varda this bijou blog you may clock there’s something multy queer about it. (There’s a bit of a palarver about “queer” these days, I savvy, but we can cackle about that another day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it’s LGBT+ History Month I thought it might be fantabulosa to have a blog parlayed in Polari. For those not savvy, Polari was a form of parlay popular in the mid 20th Century among (mostly) mauve and versatile omis – especially in Eine. It was a form of slang that grew from the docks in the east (where the sea food was to be had!) to the thumping-cheat of the west end where words were borrowed from the parlay of the joggering omis and the tober showmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that last century being “so” was illegal, and if Lilly suspected an omi of being out trolling for trade, he was likely to wake up in the queer ken. So Polari evolved so omis could parlay with omis, whether out trolling on a munge nochy or on the polari pipe, with nanti worries about a charpering omi or a gajo having an aunt nelly ajax them. It was a bona parlay for cod times! (While there is some record of palones using Polari too, there was no actual law against palone-omis, so there wasn’t multy need to use it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scharda, but after 1967 when queens could get more bold, Polari all but carked it. You may find the odd slanging queen use it, but few of the chickens today savvy this old mauve parlay at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To savvy more, varda this &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-polari-the-curious-after-life-of-the-dead-language-for-gay-men-72599&quot;&gt;bona link (and video)&lt;/a&gt; to see your actual Polari, or spend some of your geld to get your lillies on Paul Baker’s bona book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterstones.com/book/fabulosa/paul-baker/9781789142945&quot;&gt;“Fabulosa!&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Duckies, I’d better vagar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bona lavs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;translation&quot;&gt;Translation:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you look at this small blog you may notice there’s something very odd about it. (There’s a bit of a debate about “queer” these days, I know, but we can talk about that another day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it’s LGBT+ History Month I thought it might be wonderful to have a blog spoken in Polari. For those that don’t know, Polari was a form of language popular in the mid 20th Century among (mostly) gay and bisexual men – especially in London. It was a form of slang that grew from the docks in the east (where the sailors were) to the heart of the west end where words were borrowed from the slang of the entertainers and the travelling showmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that last century being gay was illegal, and if the police suspected a man of being out cruising, he was likely to wake up in prison. So Polari evolved so men could talk with men, whether out walking on a dark night or on the phone, with no worries about a policeman or an outsider listening next to them. It was a good language for bad times! (While there is some record of women using Polari too, there was no actual law against lesbians, so there wasn’t a lot of need to use it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pity, but after 1967 when gay men could be more “out”, Polari all but died out. You may find the odd stage act use it, but few of the young gay men today know this old LGBT+ language at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more, have a look at this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-polari-the-curious-after-life-of-the-dead-language-for-gay-men-72599&quot;&gt;link (and video)&lt;/a&gt; to see your actual Polari, or spend some of your money to get your hands on Paul Baker’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterstones.com/book/fabulosa/paul-baker/9781789142945&quot;&gt;“Fabulosa!&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, friends, I’d better be off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2021/02/23/ed</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2021/02/23/reflection-on-cny-history-month">&lt;h2 id=&quot;cslgbt-vice-chair-dr-edward-he-shares-his-reflections-on-chinese-new-year-and-lgbt-history-month-2021&quot;&gt;CSLGBT+ Vice Chair &lt;a href=&quot;/abous-us&quot;&gt;Dr Edward He&lt;/a&gt; shares his reflections on Chinese New Year and LGBT+ History Month 2021.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward joined the Civil Service in 2019 as a Chartered Engineer, having previously worked in higher education, R&amp;amp;D and in the heavy industry, including the steelworks, oil &amp;amp; gas and aviation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grew up in a traditional Chinese family, he has had first hand experiences on some of the challenges and barriers facing LGBT+ individuals from different cultural and ethnical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Edward has worked with various LGBT+ staff networks and organisations. He currently serves as a Vice Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, a STEM Ambassador, Council Member for the IET, as well as a Trustee for a cancer support charity in South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-you-tell-us-how-you-got-started-in-lgbt-networks&quot;&gt;Can you tell us how you got started in LGBT+ networks?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became actively involved with staff LGBT+ network when I worked at GE in Leicester from 2013 to 2018. I was co-chairing our local GE GLBTA Alliance. Shortly after I joined the Civil Service in 2019, I applied for and successfully became one of the Vice Chairs for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. It’s a great honour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a volunteer-led network based all over the UK and work very closely with cross-government and departmental D&amp;amp;I and LGBT+ networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-have-staff-di-networks&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to have staff D&amp;amp;I networks?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was brought up in a traditional Chinese family. From my own experience, it is still very challenging for many of us to be who we really are, especially those of us from BAME, other cultural or religious backgrounds. Many of us would never want to disclose our real identity to our family or friends, with the fear to be rejected. Some actually feel safer and more accepted at work than at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to help create a culture in our workplace (Civil Service) where we can truly be ourselves, value our similarities and appreciate our differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-chinese-new-year-how-has-this-chinese-new-years-compared-to-last-years&quot;&gt;Happy Chinese New Year! How has this Chinese New Years compared to last years?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a very tough year for everyone. We all had to adjust to the new working arrangements and living conditions, not being able to see our family, colleagues or friends for a long time. However, I think we can all feel the optimism and hope for 2021! This New Year will definitely be better than 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I would like to wish everyone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新年快乐！万事如意！/ Blwyddyn Newydd Tsieineaidd Dda! / A very Happy Chinese New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-also-understand-this-chinese-new-year-is-quite-a-lucky-year-to-some-with-2021-being-the-year-of-the-ox-can-you-tell-us-what-this-year-means-to-you-personally&quot;&gt;We also understand this Chinese New Year is quite a lucky year to some, with 2021 being the Year of the Ox! Can you tell us what this year means to you personally?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, follows the Lunar Calendar. It is the most important festival in Chinese culture and is celebrated by billions of people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year has a zodiac sign, represented by an animal. There are 12 zodiac (animal) signs in total, which repeat every 12 years. 12 February 2021 marks the start of the Year of the Ox. If you were/are born in 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, and of course in 2021, then this year is your zodiac year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in the Year of the Ox (I guess you can work out my age). The Ox is said to be hardworking, loyal but also stubborn. It is believed that wearing something red will bring extra luck and fortune during your zodiac year. However, according to Chinese custom, whatever red item you choose to wear, you cannot buy it yourself. It has to be given to you by a friend or family member as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;following-the-pandemic-we-have-heard-since-lockdown-began-that-our-south-east-asian-and-chinese-colleagues-are-facing-a-new-facet-of-xenophobia-what-advise-would-you-give-to-colleagues-who-have-experienced-this&quot;&gt;Following the pandemic, we have heard since lockdown began that our South East Asian and Chinese colleagues are facing a new facet of xenophobia, what advise would you give to colleagues who have experienced this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of pandemic, there has been an increase of racially motivated incidents targeting Chinese and South East Asian people. Sadly, my mum and I had also experienced it in our local shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever experience or witness it, take photos or videos as evidence if it is safe to do so, and report the incident. You can report it either as a victim or as a witness. The easiest way to report is via the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/report-hate-crime&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been a victim, do not suffer it silently. Speak up and talk to your friends, colleagues or family members. They will do everything they can to support you. I mentioned our incident to my colleagues and was overwhelmed by the kind messages and support we’ve received. The Police will also be able to provide you professional advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-during-lockdown-to-help-your-own-wellbeing&quot;&gt;What have you done during lockdown to help your own wellbeing?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been living on my own since summer last year. Fortunately, I have now formed a support buddle with my boyfriend, Phil. That has made a huge difference for our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt Tai Chi, which I practise once or twice a day. I have also been doing some small DIY projects, gardening (when weather is nice) and enjoying cooking to keep myself busy. Of course, Netflix and Amazon Prime have also become our great friends in lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;february-is-also-lgbt-history-month-what-are-your-reflections-on-this-month-and-have-you-been-able-to-mark-it&quot;&gt;February is also LGBT+ History Month, what are your reflections on this month and have you been able to mark it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we celebrate both the Chinese New Year and LGBT+ History Month in February. Have you ever noticed that the Gay Village and the Chinatown in many big cities are always next to each other? I can think of London, Birmingham, Manchester, Amsterdam, San Francisco, New York, Sydney and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to university in Birmingham. Every year (except during the pandemic), you will see our Chinese New Year being celebrated in the Gay Village, and our Pride events being celebrated in the Chinatown there. It is the same in London, Manchester and many other cities. Our two communities (Chinese and LGBT+) have coexisted and been supporting one another for decades. We are closer and more connected than many people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, both communities have also experienced rejection, discrimination and many similar challenges. Whatever our differences may be, we have and will continue to overcome these challenges when we stand side by side and support each other. We are stronger together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-you-share-a-quote-or-phrase-that-has-meant-a-lot-to-you&quot;&gt;Can you share a quote or phrase that has meant a lot to you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always say that life is too serious to be taken too seriously! Be nice, be kind and enjoy everyday! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2021/02/04/ace-ally">&lt;p&gt;As a bisexual person I feel that there is a lot about asexuality that I can empathise with. Both of our sexualities cover a broad spectrum of experiences but are quite simple to explain. Both ace and bi people are subject to inaccurate assumptions, being erased, being doubted (“How do you know you are [asexual / bisexual] if you have not tried…?”) and being asked invasive personal questions. At its worst this can lead to us being shamed, for allegedly being too sexual if you are bi or for not being sexual enough if you are ace – it seems you cannot win one way or the other sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I felt quite isolated not knowing any other bi people and, after I finally met some, not knowing whether there were any where I work. It made it particularly difficult for me to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/30/bi-alan&quot;&gt;open about my identity&lt;/a&gt; at work. It sounds obvious in hindsight but it did not occur to me until I spoke to a group of ace people that this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/27/ace-robin&quot;&gt;common experience&lt;/a&gt; for them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it feels quite natural for me to be an ace ally, be that defending their place in the LGBT+ community (the + is there for a reason and the A in the full LGBTQIA acronym stands for ace after all) or speaking out against aphobia or ace erasure. A line I find myself frequently using is that anyone saying that ace people do not belong in the LGBT+ community is proving why they need to be included as part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When lastyear the Bi+ Inclusion Team discussed what to do for Ace Week, I suggested we hold a discussion event with a panel of ace civil servants like we did for bi+ civil servants on Bi Visibility Day. I felt that it was important to give our ace colleagues visibility and a space where they could meet other ace civil servants. That turned into AceSpace at the end of October, which was one of the Bi+ Inclusion Team’s best attended events of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing some people at AceSpace meet other ace people for the first time reminded me of how validating it felt for me when I met other bi people for the first time. It was especially rewarding to see so many ace colleagues know that they were not alone, that there were others like them in the Civil Service, sometimes even in the same departments. There is a lot more that needs to be done for ace inclusion but that felt like an important step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an ace civil servant and want to meet other ace colleagues, please join us at our regular BiSpace events and our new AceSpace socials, which will take place bi-monthly going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite another national lockdown, more home working and endless Microsoft Team calls, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a:gender are dedicated to remaining on its mission to continue virtually supporting all LGBTQ+ civil servants across the country, and to ensure that colleagues have access to resources and materials that will encourage their educational empowerment and allyship amongst our growing family and within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that we are commemorating our community’s history through an annual month-long celebration this February 2021 of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have partnered up with fellow civil servant and a qualified historian in Queer Heritage, Dr Jonah Coman from Social Security Scotland and his incredible network of historians, who are each equipped with the impressive and intriguing knowledge and experience to deliver such valuable sessions that will surely leave you asking for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from an initiative that was created in 2005, educators and activists Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick organised LGBT History Month in the UK as part of a Schools Out UK. Such a programme existed to teach young people about the issue’s members of the LGBT+ community face on a daily basis, and to make schools feel inclusive for everyone, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every February, LGBT History Month is marked by schools, colleges and various organisations across the country, who seek to increase young people’s awareness of the LGBT+ community through education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT History Month provides us with inspirational role models, builds stronger and supportive communities and represents a civil rights statement about the astounding contributions of the LGBTQ+ community. So, honour those who have come before us and raise awareness of the work we still have left to do. The fight for equality is far from over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So grab fuel up the flux capacitor in your DeLorean, jump into your Tardis or grab your time vortex manipulator as we journey through periods of queer history and explore the past like you have never experienced before!&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/12/10/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Awards-2020">&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-are-honoured-to-have-won-the-employee-network-excellence-award-at-the-civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-awards-2020-a-huge-well-done-to-our-whole-leadership-team-regional-reps-and-volunteers-we-would-also-like-to-say-thank-you-to-our-network-members---this-is-as-much-your-award-as-it-is-ours&quot;&gt;We are honoured to have won ‘The Employee Network Excellence Award’ at the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards 2020. A huge well done to our whole leadership team, regional reps and volunteers. We would also like to say thank you to our network members - this is as much your award as it is ours.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards 2020 took place virtually on Friday 4th December. There were a record 297 nominations for the awards this year, all of which showed how much inspiring and innovative work is making a difference across the Civil Service. All of the winners from the awards will now go forward to the D&amp;amp;I category of the Civil Service Awards in February 2021, where they will form the category shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the full list of winners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/winners&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-the-leadership-team&quot;&gt;From the leadership team:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awards this year really showcased the amazing and outstanding work that civil servants do to help each other. As you know, diversity and inclusion is at the forefront of the Civil Service LGBT+ network’s agenda and it was great to hear about what other staff networks, individuals and teams are doing across the civil service on supporting this. More importantly, it was clear to see that through collaborative work we can help the civil service be the most open, fair and inclusive employer. We hope that over the next year we can continue to support LGBT+ civil servants in the best way we possibly can and work together with other staff networks on joint initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know this year has been tough for so many of us, and even in these difficult, busy and stressful times we have stuck together as a network of volunteers and continued to deliver – for that, we offer our greatest thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to extend our congratulations to all the other winners and nominees – it really does show the inspiring and innovative work that takes place in our workplace. We look forward to virtually seeing everyone at the Civil Service Awards in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed, Jordon, Rikesh, Kate, James, Marc, Leah &amp;amp; Astrid&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/11/20/tdor-blog-2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TDoR 2020: What Trans Day of Remembrance actually represents" />

			<updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/11/20/tdor-blog-two</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/11/20/tdor-blog-2">&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-blog-post-has-been-written-by-a-member-of-agender&quot;&gt;This blog post has been written by a member of a:gender.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks International transgender day of remembrance, which was inaugurated in 1999 following the murder of Rita Hester, who was found with more than twenty stab wounds to her chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin by speaking of what TDoR actually represents, even though the title itself should tell us. I will apologise in advance, for I will get emotional, but I am sure you will understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will stress that today is not just a day of mourning, but one of celebration of life, which is the way all such occasions should be marked. Nevertheless, we continue to mourn people such as these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leelah, who put on dark clothing and walked down a major road in the dark, no longer able to cope with her family’s transphobia. She was only 17, and got four miles before the first lorry hit her.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dee, stabbed 237 times, mostly in the face, as she went back to a hotel room with a man she clearly thought was a decent human being. He stayed with her for twenty minutes, just long enough to have sex with her, but already had the knife with him. She was 25.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rita, the original symbol of TDoR, stabbed dozens of times and left dead on the floor of her room. She was killed two days before her 35th birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lucy Meadows, a UK teacher hounded by a newspaper columnist for no other reason than that she was a trans woman, who took her own life. She was 32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at the horrendous murder rates of trans people in Brazil and other countries, and we mourn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the heightened suicide risk for unsupported trans children, and we mourn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at the recent death of Naomi Hersi, murdered in a Heathrow hotel room in March last year, whose death is excused by bigots as not worth worrying about because “he was a sex worker”, and we mourn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the wave of murders of trans women of colour in America, so many of whom are sex workers only because when society leaves you no room to live, no right to a home and free to be sacked from any job that you might find, selling your body is the difference between starvation and a half-life, and we mourn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is that other side, though, the celebration of lives that are now lost.  People whose lives have been snuffed out still remind us of what the human spirit can achieve, and that is what we should hold to today. There is a picture of Naomi Hersi that has been used in every news report, and it is of a smiling woman, clearly happy in her life. Dee Whigham had finally found her life, and was on a ‘girls’ weekend’ with other women. This does not alter the horror or the brutality of how they died, but it does give additional focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waves of hatred that are directed at trans people can feel unbearable. Recently, a well -known campaigner against trans rights, who features regularly on television, responded to a question about the possible effects of Hormone replacement therapy on trans women, described, naturally as “men”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What would the effect be?” was the question, and her response was two words: “Death, hopefully”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not here to speak at length about that hatred, for it is evident and obvious for anyone with a few minutes to look at the press or social media, with 323 trans hate articles in one newspaper alone in 2018. It is there, though, and it is real. Sometimes, that reality can become personal, and it did so for me, quite recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 21st, I was myself physically attacked by a man in broad daylight, on Broad Street, in fact, in Birmingham. All very alliterative, and the reasons for the attack were made very clear when he asked repeatedly “What sort of &lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;* queer are you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up bruised, and in shock. Fortunately, I was on my way to help set up the a:gender conference, so when I made it into the venue, into a place of safety, after spending half a mile watching over my shoulder in case he came back, when I was finally safe, and broke down, I had friends around me who understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sort of incident has a profound effect on mental health, and my own has suffered over the years. I am actually a mental health first aider, so I am perhaps more able to recognise the impact simple, callous bigotry has on my life, and understand its impact on others. I regularly see negative comments about being transgender as a form of mental illness, and there is a high level of mental health problems associated with transgender people, but I would suggest that it is a simple case of cause and effect. If you are being told on a daily basis, for example, that your mere existence is a threat to women and girls, it can be a little difficult to maintain that stiff upper lip, or indeed a balanced response to adversity of all kinds. There is a coordinated attack on trans people in the UK, largely funded by right-wing groups in the USA, and they have made their plans very clear. In their words, the way to untangle the alphabet soup of LGBTQ etc is to start with the weakest letter, the T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have made it abundantly clear that once they have removed rights for that alphabet soup, they will be after the rights of women. At the moment, there is a US court case underway concerning Aimee,  a trans woman working as an undertaker. When she announced her transition, she was sacked. The employers tried to justify it as religious conscience, but that was thrown out of court. They are now basing their claims on dress codes, that as Aimee is “a man”, she must wear a collar and tie, while women wear skirts and high heels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several well-known anti-trans activists from the UK have travelled there, to stand alongside neoNazis and misogynists in order to support forcing gender stereotypes onto all women simply so that trans women can be discriminated against. That bigotry, that hatred, is clearly visceral and unthinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now see a new group calling itself an LGB Alliance, claiming that it is there to represent LGB people. All but one of its first 100 tweets was about trans people. As an additional titbit, their members include someone who hates bisexual people, as well as all men, and another who recently claimed that bisexuals “erase women”. The pressure is relentless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to that day in Birmingham, I am in no way attempting to compare what I went through, and have done on many previous occasions, with the events involving Dee, Rita, Leelah, Lucy or Naomi. What I suffered is utterly insignificant compared to the horrors that have taken so many trans women in Brazil, so often found in shallow graves or, awfully, on internet videos as they are beaten to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I am one of the really lucky ones. My emotion is one of gratitude; not for the deaths of others, but for the fact that I am here today to mourn those who weren’t as fortunate, and to give thanks that I am allowed to do something, however small, to help explain what has happened, to raise awareness, and to try and stir people up to work against hatred. I am grateful that I have people around me to offer support, to lift me up, and, yes, to put their arms around me when I break down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I do feel hate; I would be an obvious liar if I pretended otherwise, and I wouldn’t be human if I didn’t feel that way. That isn’t the way forward, though. What I should be doing, what I am urging you all to do today, is to take a moment of silent contemplation, to remember so many dead, and perhaps to ask yourselves what you might do to encourage that hatred to leave. To help others to understand what fellow humanity means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to think of Naomi’s smiling face, of Dee’s delight on her weekend away with the other girls. Life, joy, futures opening up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more seventeen-year-old girls walking down an unlit road and waiting for a lorry to hit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 20th Is Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day where people across the world remember trans men and trans women killed. It is a day to reflect and think about victims of hate crime. Often in horrific circumstances. Think about Naomi Hersi, found stabbed to death in a hotel room in West London. Or Islan Nettles, beaten to death in the street. Maybe the case of Chucha Reyes, whose decapitated head was placed in a refrigerator left dumped in front of the City Hall. Or the body of Maya Akbar, which was found, riddled with bullets on a river bank. As a proud trans woman, I would ask for your support for me and my community, however, if you are reading these words, chances are that you probably already support trans rights. I will ask you to spare a few moments of your time to think and reflect on the lives of fellow human beings murdered. People executed for whom they are. Sons, daughters, lovers, strangers, all human, none of whom deserved the death that they met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I changed my gender presentation, I would not give a second thought about when and where I went. This year, whilst going about my job I was sexually harassed in Hyde Park walking back from MOD Main Building, a friend of mine was harassed in the middle of Birmingham on their way to meet me and another friend at the DWP offices. I did not meet my maker, in a premature and violent death and neither did my friend, but neither of us deserved to be scared, violated, humiliated by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is not being written to try and influence anybody’s mind or opinion on transgender issues. It is to invite any allies (cis- or trans- gender) to give a little thought to those who have lost their lives as a result of a transphobic hate crime. I invite you to take a few moments of quiet reflection at 12:00 on 20 November. This is the time of remembrance for victims of transphobic hate crime. If you read this after this time, then any quiet reflection upon finishing this article is suitable, should you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 20th brings us this sombre event once more, on which we take a moment to remember those trans people who have lost their lives in the past year. I have written a number of pieces for Spectrum (Spectrum is the Home Office LGBT+ Network) on this subject, and unsurprisingly they have concentrated on the victims of violence and hatred who have died unnecessarily over the years, simply for the ‘crime’ of being a transgender person. From its origins as an event initiated after the brutal murder of Rita Hester, stabbed more than thirty times, through deaths of women like Dee Whigham, 25, stabbed more than a hundred times, mostly in the face, or the suicide of Leelah Alcorn at 17, to reports that the life expectancy of a trans woman of colour in the USA is no more than 35 years, it remains a brutal and painful subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to dwell on individual losses this year: I want to write about myself. Not as narcissism, but in recognition of how very, very lucky I am in both the times I am living through and the place I inhabit. I see a purpose beyond remembering our dead, and working to stop more people using their lives, and that is simply counting my blessings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am considerably older than many who will be reading this, as I was born in the 1950s. My first hint that there are people like me was from a newspaper hatchet job on April Ashley, and the court case Corbett V Corbett. I have lived through a number of legal changes, such as s28, and the enactments of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Equality Act 2010. While there are issues with those two statutes, they are better than I ever dreamt possible as a scared and lonely child. I work for an employer who respects my gender identity, and actively listens to what I and others like me tell them. Despite unrelenting attacks from hate groups and all parts of the press, I have a chance to make a difference for the better, which is a blessing beyond price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with some other parts of the world, I do indeed have an easy life. Poland and Hungary, for example, have launched severe attacks on the rights of transgender and non-binary people. Poland has recently removed the right of trans people to transition legally. Russia has been attacking trans rights for many years, including such back-door nastiness as revoking their driving licences on the basis of gender dysphoria being defined by their government as a ‘mental disorder’. The level of violence against trans women in Brazil never fails to shock me, and, as I have described in earlier pieces, the level of violence is almost unimaginable. It isn’t the simple fact of murder, but the frenzy evident in the act that shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the excuses. I have mentioned the low life expectancy of BAME trans women in the USA, and that is largely a result of direct bigotry. Where you can be legally sacked and evicted from your home, just for being trans, often the only way to survive is by sex work. I have read countless articles explaining the death rate as “Well, sex workers, risky job, isn’t it? Should have chosen a safer lifestyle”. Circular ‘logic’ of the worst sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently in the USA, several States have removed a legal defence for murder from their law books, the plea of “Gay/trans panic”. In essence, it is deemed reasonable to murder someone after sex if they turn out to be trans, or the assailant suspects they are trans. It is also an acceptable defence for murdering someone who the killer claims, in essence, looked at them in a way they interpreted as sexual, which can mean something as innocuous as simply making eye contact. When I say ‘several States’, I mean eight. The first was California, as recently as 2014. In 42 US States, therefore, it is considered reasonable to kill a woman for perhaps having hands a little larger then expected, or a man for being slightly colourful in his clothing choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise if some of the above comes across as flippant, but I find the whole concept to be utterly and incredibly wrong. I have attached a right-wing press article below, which ‘justifies’ the concept, but I would advise the need for a strong stomach if you choose to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it. I sit here typing this out, living my real life, living as myself. I receive regular abuse, and occasional physical attacks, but my life is overflowing with blessings so many others lack, and I am alive to enjoy them. So many others are not. That is the meaning of Trans Day of Remembrance: we may not be able to fulfil a promise of ‘Never again’, but we can all do our best to work towards that goal, and remember those without the blessings I am still counting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This blog post originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2020/11/16/mums-sewing-machine/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gemma-kinsey-employee-at-the-ea-and-exec-secretary-of-agender-talks-about-her-experiences-to-mark-transgender-awareness-week&quot;&gt;Gemma Kinsey, employee at the EA and Exec Secretary of a:gender, talks about her experiences to mark Transgender Awareness Week.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to my parents, my Mum mentioned she wanted to clear out some old stuff and asked if I would like to take her sewing machine. A little surprised at this diversion from our usual ‘How are you?’, ‘Do you need any shopping?’, ‘How’s Dad?’ conversation, I said ok so long as she was sure she wanted to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving home with the sewing machine in the car, I thought back to being very small and looking up at the dining room table on which my Mum was ceremoniously unveiling the machine for the first time; it was shiny and gleaming with many mysterious wheels and dials and buttons. A thing of wonder to my young eyes, I must have reached with interested little hands. I was told sharply, ‘don’t touch’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood back a bit to watch my Mum connecting the foot pedal and plugging in to the wall socket - It was an electric machine! Her mum (my grandma) had only had a hand-cranked machine. I remember seeing the reels of cotton and my Mum picking one, setting it on the holder, and delicately poking the thread through cryptic holes, under and over, and around a springy thing, and down to the glinting needle. I wanted to stay and see what how it would all work, how it would stitch the fabric. Silently, I stepped a little closer to see … and was promptly taken to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I went to the table but the machine was gone. It had been put away. I wasn’t to see it working again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned home and brought Mum’s machine in from the car, I removed the cover cautiously – and there it was. I hadn’t laid eyes on it for more years than I could remember but it was unchanged even though it now seemed heavy and silent, also more mundane, the dials more knowable, and the technology very definitely dated. I gave it a dust and examined the odds-and-ends in the little compartment, I even found the original guarantee card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the sewing machine wasn’t something that I was ‘allowed’ to be interested in, the irony is that in the end my Mum never really used it that much either. Chatting about sewing, and dressmaking in the intervening years, my Mum admitted she’d tried making a dress from a paper pattern once but hadn’t enjoyed it, that she’d only got the machine because ‘everyone had one’ at that time, and after that first try she only used it a couple more times to do some alterations. So it turns out my Mum didn’t enjoy doing something that was expected of her, she didn’t want to do what her peer group were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I wonder if she might have had more fun learning together with her young daughter, that is if she’d known she had a young daughter, but neither of us knew that back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, the sewing machine was yet another thing to feel guilty about. From the earliest age I can remember, there were myriad ‘things’ that I wasn’t supposed to say or do or be. Many unspoken but tacitly enforced. Equally the many things I was supposed to do, say and be weren’t me either. I came to see myself as ‘not right’, a mistake. I had no other words to help me express myself, there was no internet, and no Google and I had no one to confide in. But even as child I knew my truth and I learned the world was hostile to me. So I learned to hide me. I hid by keeping quiet, by keeping away from other people. My Mum always did wonder why I preferred learning from instruction manuals and text books, it was because they never said whether or not I was allowed to join in, they didn’t judge me. Whether I wanted to learn sewing or learn welding, read fiction or study microbiology – the books didn’t judge me as an individual or gate keep my personal validity, even if one of my vintage Singer sewing manuals is notoriously riddled with Atomic Age misogyny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/taw-blog-pic.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on to study biology and research environmental microbiology at university. But even learning that the natural world is far more diverse and gloriously imperfect than I could ever have imagined still didn’t help me in the human world, the workplace was still a hostile place for me. I kept hiding me, but ultimately hiding is harmful – my own critical point came about ten years ago, the cumulative pressure of not being me, brought me to face a stark decision, either be me or don’t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping back from the precipice took a while and all my meagre savings plus a few more ups-and-downs. In the process I became distanced from the few people that I thought I knew and it cost me my career as a lead researcher in sustainable agriculture. But I was lucky, very lucky. With the aid of the internet I was able to find resources and support, and the waiting time for a first NHS appointment was a mere three months (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/13/nhs-trans-patients-laurels-gender-identity-clinic-south-west-waiting-list-yeovil-pride/&quot;&gt;waiting times&lt;/a&gt; are now approaching four years at some clinics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Environment Agency I found a new career and an employer that is not only super inclusive on paper but works hard to live its values with just as much passion as it pursues its aim of creating a better place. The EA works really hard to go above and beyond the bare minimum required for compliance with the Equality Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is after all no limit to kindness and inclusivity beyond that which we set for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is all the more important right now. We’re at a time when intolerance is rising and mainstream media is regularly carrying dog-whistle misinformation that portrays difference and diversity as a threat. The upshot is a surge in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/23/uk-lgbt-hate-crimes-stats-make-shocking-reading&quot;&gt;UK LGBT+ hate crime&lt;/a&gt; (even allowing for increased levels of reporting) and a decrease in prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galop.org.uk/online-hate-crime-report-2020/&quot;&gt;Galop’s 2020 hate crime report&lt;/a&gt; shows that 8 in 10 LGBT+ people have experienced online abuse and half of those targeted had experienced hate more than 20 times. The impact is that social media, the way we all now connect with each other particularly in this year of Coronavirus restrictions, is not a safe space for trans people, and I have experienced this personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face-to-face, the emboldening of bigotry and hatred has manifested as an 81% increase in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/06/27/transgender-hate-crimes-rocket-81-uk/&quot;&gt;transphobic hate crime&lt;/a&gt; in 2018/19, and in the last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2020#other-types-of-violence&quot;&gt;ONS figures&lt;/a&gt; show that transgender people are twice as likely as cisgender people to be the victims of crime in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really strange thing is this is at odds with how the majority of people in the UK think about trans folk. Despite the majority of people having never knowingly met a trans person, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/10/british-social-attitudes-transphobia-trans-prejudice-equality-human-rights-commission/&quot;&gt;British social attitudes survey&lt;/a&gt; showed that 76% of people in the UK consider prejudice against trans people to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking down on my Mum’s sewing machine, now on my dining room table, I put its cover back on and carefully put it away. It was time to get my own sewing machine out and finish the dress I’m currently working on (without my ‘powder and lipstick’ and without my hair ‘in order’!). As I lined up the fabric to sew one of the side seams, I spotted I’d left the old guarantee card on the table, the purchase date was still readable; April 1969. I was four years old when I first saw my Mum’s sewing machine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;hr /&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Public Sector Equality Duty came in to force in April 2011 (s.149 of the Equality Act 2010) and public authorities are now required, in carrying out their functions, to have due regard to the need to achieve the objectives set out under s149 of the Equality Act 2010 to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act 2010;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(b) advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(c) foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service is working to be the most inclusive employer by 2020. a:gender advocates that everyone is treated as though they have a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 and that workplace policies reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-intersex&quot;&gt;What is intersex?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Intersex people are born with a mix of anatomical sex traits (chromosomes, hormones, genitals and/or reproductive organs) that do not fit typical ideas about male and female bodies. This may be apparent at birth or become so later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many forms of intersex exist; it’s not a single category. Intersex variations may or may not be accompanied by degrees of gender dysphoria (not feeling like the sex you were recorded at birth). Intersex variations are a perfectly normal, naturally occurring variation of human development; they are as common as having red hair.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;diagnosis&quot;&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s obvious that a baby is intersex because of visible differences at birth, but many intersex babies look typically male or female and so many people don’t find out they’re intersex until puberty or after issues with infertility, some find out later in life, some may not find out at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many are not explicitly told they are intersex which prevents them from finding support among their peers and making informed decisions about their own healthcare. Those operated on at birth to assign them to a binary sex are often not informed of their surgery as adults. This secrecy leads many intersex people to carry a sense of stigma and shame about their bodies and further silences them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;language&quot;&gt;Language&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Disorders of Sexual Development (DSD) is a term that has been coined by the medical profession to refer to intersex people. It is widely condemned as offensive by intersex individuals who argue that if something occurs naturally and throughout all species, it is not a disorder. Many intersex people feel that this pathologising language reinforces the idea that they need “fixing”, which in turn perpetuates the practice of subjecting intersex infants to unnecessary and non-consensual surgeries to assign them to a binary sex chosen for them, not by them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should also avoid reference to intersex conditions for this reason – it’s preferable to refer to intersex variations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many intersex people also find the word “hermaphrodite” outdated and offensive – it’s also inaccurate as it doesn’t cover what it means to be intersex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Using the term “intersex” is generally acceptable, with “endosex” as the preferred term for non-intersex people, but language constantly evolves, and you should be aware that these preferred terms may change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;intersex-rights-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Intersex Rights in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Intersex people who undergo gender reassignment have some protection under the Equality Act 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Malta and Portugal have banned some medical interventions on intersex people that are legal in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-workplace&quot;&gt;In the workplace&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite a population estimated to be up to three times as large as the Trans population, concessions to intersex staff are often non-existent, or else they are grouped in with LGBT or even disability networks, becoming overlooked and ignored as a result:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The inclusion of Intersex alongside LGBT is problematic, because intersex people’s issues are legally, medically, and socially different from those of LGBT people. If ‘I’ is to be placed with LGBT then it is necessary to fully include, resource, and acknowledge intersex people, and to address their specific concerns, [however] the established nature of the LGBT ‘sector’ in the UK provides an opportunity for useful collaborations and alliances [as] it has both an existing infrastructure and political profile; these are starkly lacking for intersex people.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some will remain undiagnosed, having no developmental or health issues, others may have to manage significant issues. Examples include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;feeling different and being different&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;not fitting into the binary gender society expectations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;complications over personal relationships&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;infertility and/or sterility&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;subjected to comments regarding genitalia&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;subjected to comments about gender-incongruent bodily appearance, such as facial and body hair, voice, height, male pattern baldness.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Problems with dressing for the workplace, finding clothing that follows a dress code or obtaining a uniform.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;being excluded from certain activities and clubs where the activities are based around being either male or female, especially in sports where there is increasing prevalence of testing for performance-enhancing substances such as exogenous testosterone.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the trauma of undergoing invasive tests, and ongoing long-term appointments with specialists who may practice in geographically remote locations from the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;a:gender encourages all departments and agencies to raise awareness over intersex issues, including provision for them in relevant policies, for example absence management for treatment. In the absence of intersex-specific policies, you should treat absences for treatment as if the individual was undergoing treatment for gender-reassignment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;staff-who-parent-an-intersex-child&quot;&gt;Staff who parent an Intersex Child&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As well as civil servants who are themselves intersex, a considerable number will parent an intersex child.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Current NHS guidelines state that new-born infants who appear to be intersex will undergo chromosome pattern blood tests and that the birth registration should be delayed until these tests can be carried out. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a birth must be registered within 42 days, or 21 days in Scotland. The parents should also have a team of support, including a psychologist and family worker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Many parents will only discover their child is intersex when puberty does not progress as expected. This can be mentally and emotionally challenging for the adolescent and the parent supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Parents may also be subject to stigma, discrimination and common misconceptions that can cause issues in the workplace. Although there are measures of support available from the NHS, a:gender is also open to support staff members who parent an intersex child.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-support-intersex-colleagues-as-a-manager&quot;&gt;How to support intersex colleagues as a manager&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a colleague comes out to you as intersex, respect their confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take them somewhere private where they will feel comfortable talking to you
and let them take their time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They may trust you with some extremely personal or upsetting information,
try not to be embarrassed or awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Use your organisation’s guidance to help you understand how to have this
conversation in a helpful and supportive way. Remember everyone’s journey is different.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself why this individual has come to speak to you about this now? What does the individual need? How can you support them?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Be honest about your own knowledge and experience, and that you may need time to find responses and resources. Reassure the individual that you will come back to them if you do need additional time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;support them if they come out to their colleagues; do not leave them to tell people by themselves unless they request this. If they disclose this information to their team, monitor the rest of the team and how they respond to the individual. You should take feedback from the individual seriously and deal with it promptly and appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;a:gender actively supports intersex individuals in the workplace. If you are worried,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;a:gender can provide further guidance and help you to feel confident and able to support the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;confidentiality&quot;&gt;Confidentiality&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Managers must note the need for absolute confidentiality around an employee’s medical and intersex history. Local records should be managed appropriately. Gain the consent of the person before you share this information. In open-plan teams, it may be easy to identify people by the sharing of personal information or if discussions are overheard or poorly worded. You must make a conscious effort to maintain confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intersex is the term for a person whose body doesn’t fit binary notions about male and female&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intersex people are commonplace; there are many naturally-occurring intersex variations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Intersex people (like members of many other groups) may need specific support in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All intersex people should be treated as if they are protected by equality legislation. Workplaces policies should be intersex-inclusive&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a:gender can offer support to intersex civil servants, their managers and colleagues and those who parent an intersex child. If you need further support or advice, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:agender@homeoffice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;agender@homeoffice.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/28/ace-HMT">&lt;p&gt;Being asexual, on the aromantic spectrum and Asian are core parts that form my identity and like many aspects, I just wouldn’t be complete if one was erased. However, they have come to intersect with other parts of my life that present unique struggles. The unique struggles that can come with being (aro)ace and Asian is what I would like to talk about in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asian society, there is often a strong societal pressure once you reach your late teens/early 20s to begin to look towards marriage. What starts off as subtle nudges and jokes about boyfriends/girlfriends and romance evolves into outright questions of when you will get married, why you haven’t gotten a partner, and unwanted involvement from parents and relations on what they think is best for you. When many of your relatives have gotten married at socially appropriate times or are in relationships, it is difficult to hold out to what you really want. This is even more so if you are asexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, asexuality is not widely known or discussed with Asian families and communities. Families may be reluctant to budge against norms and what they think will guarantee you happiness in life, a tried and tested path. Indeed, it would throw a wrench into a key part of the life mapped out for one in society: to get married and have children. I personally have been told to ‘grow up and live in the real world’ when it comes to marriage and asexuality, even though I had never come out or even hinted at my orientation - this was a passing comment made by another family member when I voiced dismissiveness against getting married. I am still expected to get married and, in that vein, produce children as if it is a natural part of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was hurtful. To unintentionally be told that you aren’t even part of the real world, inhabiting a kind of fantasy, seems to insinuate that I myself am not real. But I am. I am Asian, asexual and very real. I may not end up in a ‘romantic’ or ‘sexual’ relationship because I am not sure I experience that type of attraction. Since the society we live in is very relationship and romance oriented this can be difficult to deal with. But not being in relationships does not mean you do not care for family; does not mean you are not able to form meaningful attachments in relationships of any kind. If you are Asian, of any age, orientation or gender, I implore you to look to change attitudes in your families and communities. Asexuality is not destructive to family relationships or ‘wrong’, it is just what some people are! Marriage and children are not and shouldn’t be end goals in life, there is so much more to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/27/ace-robin" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="#AceWeek: (Not) the only ace in the village?" />
			<published>2020-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2020-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/27/ace-robin">&lt;p&gt;“Maybe this will be the year they finally acknowledge that asexual people exist,” I thought to myself as I opened up the 2020 Civil Service People Survey. I self-identify as a heteroromantic asexual woman, as I am attracted romantically but not sexually to men, and have spent several years campaigning to have an “asexual” option added to the sexual orientation options in this survey (previously the only ones listed have been “Heterosexual/straight,” “Gay or lesbian,” “Bisexual,” “Other” or “Prefer not to say.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the internet age, few people had even heard of the term “asexual” in relation to human sexuality. Our community has grown in strength since the late 1990s, with many ace-related sites now online. The most prolific and well-known of these sites is the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), which was founded in 2001 by David Jay and now has over 70,000 members. The asexual community has also adopted its own Pride symbols, such the asexual flag, which consists of four horizontal stripes: black, grey, white, and purple. The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe represents the grey area between sexual and asexual, the white stripe represents sexuality, and the purple stripe represents community. Some asexual people also wear a black ring on the middle finger to symbolise their orientation (mine has a dove in the centre and I sometimes wear it during Asexual Awareness Week, which is observed every year in late October).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asexual people face similar issues to the bisexual community, who sometimes experience discrimination from both gay and straight peers, as well as being under-represented by the media. Ace identities are constantly erased or belittled in popular culture – the canonically-ace character Jughead from the “Archie” comics was heterosexualised in the TV adaptation Riverdale, while an ace couple in the TV show House were revealed to be “not really” asexual, as one partner had a medical condition which affected his sex drive and the other was “pretending” to be ace to keep him happy. As David Jay noted about this offensive portrayal: “The episode encourages viewers to meet asexuality with skepticism rather than acceptance, to probe asexual people for causes of our “condition” rather than to accept us as a part of the natural spectrum of human sexual diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a personal perspective, I am fortunate not to have experienced any such discrimination on the basis of my sexuality (aphobia) at work (sadly, dating as an asexual person is a different story, as the view of asexuality as something that is “fake” or can be “fixed” or “cured” is still prevalent). There are still many misconceptions out there with regard to asexuality though: when I discussed possible future wedding plans with one colleague, he asked: “But how can you get married if you are asexual?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service have taken several steps to increase ace inclusion over the past few years. In 2018, the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance changed its name to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, to demonstrate that this network is for everyone with a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. They also run events across the country that are open and welcoming to asexual people via BiSpace, an initiative run by bi+ civil servants for bi+ civil servants, which includes an online forum to discuss ace-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to get back to the current People Survey… having reached the third page of the “About you” section, the “Other” option was still present, but now there was an additional “free text” box to enter my sexual orientation. So for the first time, I am able to record my asexuality on the staff survey. While we still have a long way to go to attain full visibility, progress has been made and I am still hopeful that in the near future it will no longer be necessary to tick the “other” box at all. #AcesAreNotOther!&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/26/rebecca-ace" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="#AceWeek: Ace diversity and inclusion starts with Ace visibility" />
			<published>2020-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/10/26/rebecca-ace">&lt;p&gt;Ace (short for asexual and/or aromantic) people are few and far between, as we make up a very small proportion of the population, and I expect that many ace people do not realise that they are ace as they are not aware of that possibility. Most of the people I speak to do not know what asexuality means or even that it exists. So in order to improve Ace inclusion in the civil service, I think we first need to increase Ace visibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are a couple of simple ways to increase ace visibility in the workplace beyond Asexuality Visibility Week. The first is something that we can all do and that is to remember to use the ‘plus’ in LGBT+ when talking about the LGBT+ community. This is a clear reminder that there are other letters, and so identities, in the community outside of the L, G, B and T. These include, but are by no means limited to, asexual and aromantic people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other simple step to increase Ace visibility is to include Ace Champions on LGBT+ network committees. These Champions will help network members and wider communities become aware of asexuality. The cross-civil service network added an Asexual Champion to its committee in January 2019 and the Fast Stream LGBT+ network committee followed suit shortly thereafter. I am now the Ace Champion on the Fast Stream committee and am passionate about representation for everyone under the ‘plus’ in LGBT+. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming an Ace champion for your departmental LGBT+ network, do get in touch with your network chairs to start a conversation around Ace visibility and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This post originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/taking-pride-who-we-oliver-walsh/?trackingId=XmhlmbNVSRe2bwXhP7YhzA%3D%3D&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oliver-is-a-creative-producer-and-digital-content-designer-at-dwp-digital&quot;&gt;Oliver is a Creative Producer and Digital Content Designer at DWP Digital&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first time I came out at work was after I relocated from Ireland to London. I was in a new job working with people from all over the world. One of my colleagues had a gay flatmate that she used to talk about, so one day, after several months I dropped the fact that I’m also gay into the conversation and that was it. I had already made some good friends there and they all accepted me without judgement. All the concerns that I’d worked up in my head just disappeared and it felt wonderful to just be accepted for who I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, more than a third of LGBT+ people have hidden or disguised that they are LGBT+ at work because they were afraid of discrimination. And according to a 2018 Stonewall report, 58% of young people are more likely to hide their sexuality when they start their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back ‘into the closet’ is something I’ve been conscious of when I’ve changed companies or moved jobs. With each job it can often feel like you’re coming out all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing our whole self to work is so important. Luckily I work at DWP Digital, an organisation where I can be myself and have the freedom to be who I really am. Being my true self is something I strive for and as a teammate this makes me more proactive, motivated and helps me excel at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been with DWP Digital for over a year now. When I first joined my manager encouraged me to join DWPride (our LGBT+ support network) and introduced me to Rachel Poole. Having a team mate like Rachel has helped me feel even more comfortable in bringing my authentic self to work. I don’t just see Rachel as a colleague but consider her a dear friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel fully accepted at work for who I am and what I can bring to the table, not just professionally but from my own life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LGBT+ people we’re a minority group and it’s important that we support and lift each other up. So be proud, be true and most of all be kind to yourself and others.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/30/bi-alan">&lt;p&gt;I am not going to talk about what bisexuality is, as my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/20/bi-mark&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/bi-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;Bisexuality Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt; have already done an excellent job of that. Instead I’m going to share my experience of coming out as bi at work over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year on Bi Visibility Day I made a resolution to myself that I would spend the coming year being more visible. I made that decision for a number of reasons. Partly because I was tired of feeling like I was constantly hiding part of myself. And partly because I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/bullied-bisexual-prison-officer-ben-plaistow-unlikely-work-again-tribunal&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; about a bisexual civil servant who was bullied and harassed for who he was, which deeply upset me and made me feel a certain sense of moral obligation to make myself visible to support my fellow bi civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unsure how I was going to achieve that, particularly as I am often shy in social situations and had not previously felt comfortable talking about personal matters at work. I was also conscious that although my office had LGBT-inclusive policies, there were few visible LGBT+ staff members and as a result LGBT+ issues were seldom talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later I bought myself a lanyard in the colours of the Bi Pride flag (pink, purple and blue) to wear my work ID on, in the hope that this would be a subtle way of being visible, at least to other bi people who might recognise the colours. I was extremely nervous the first day I wore my new lanyard to the office, wondering whether people would notice and ask what it was. To my dismay exactly that happened two hours later when, in a crowded lift full of people, a colleague commented on the lanyard and asked me what it was. I awkwardly explained that it was a Pride symbol, that I felt there was not enough visibility in our office and that I hoped to lead by example. There followed a period of silence before we all got off the lift. Not exactly how I imagined my first morning of being visible to go but it was a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards I decided to write a blog post for my office’s intranet about bi visibility and why I felt it was important at work. As we had no LGBT network, I didn’t know who to turn to for support, so I eventually asked a friendly colleague I felt I could trust, for whose support I remain extremely grateful. I then submitted it to the communications team, who could not have been more supportive and encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post was eventually published at the beginning of this year. I have seldom been as anxious as I was on the day it went up – I am used to dealing with all manner of acrimonious situations in my day job but sharing such a personal part of myself to 500 people was definitely outside my usual comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my delight I received numerous messages of support from colleagues across my office who had read and appreciated what I wrote. It started a number of conversations about LGBT+ issues that had not previously been talked about. From those conversations a few colleagues and I decided to launch an LGBT+ network. It turned out that a lot of people were happy to see us finally have a network, everyone was just waiting for someone else to take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I took the step of coming out at work. It took a lot of mental effort and involved a significant amount of self-doubt but now that it’s done it feels like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders to no longer hide such a big part of who I am from my colleagues. Or in corporate HR jargon, I now feel able to bring my whole self to work. It has also allowed me to connect with other bi+ civil servants through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/bispace/&quot;&gt;BiSpace&lt;/a&gt;, get involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/our-team/bi-inclusion/&quot;&gt;Bi+ Inclusion Team&lt;/a&gt;, host a virtual discussion on how to be bi and visible at work, and guest speak at a bi visibility event at the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether to come out at work is a deeply personal decision that everyone needs to make based on their personal circumstances. For me doing it was one of the best professional decisions I have made and I hope that I can provide the visibility and support that allows other bi+ civil servants to do the same should they wish to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know from feedback from members and through activity on social media that one of the groups profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is LGBTI+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With Civil Service offices reopening across the country LGBTI+people have experienced both increased anxiety for some in our communities and reduced anxiety for others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is a complex picture and will be different for each individual and their own situation. As a result we have worked with a:gender to put together a slide pack to help managers to understand those complexities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Every individual needs to have a conversation with their manager to review risks before returning to the office and this document is designed to support both parties in those conversations and provide a way of raising the issues without having to vocalise them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’re LGBTI+ and COVID-19 has affected your mental health or your living arrangements, or you have concerns about going back to the office or you would prefer to return to the office, but you are unsure on what steps to take then please share these slides with your manager to introduce the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-i-use-the-resources&quot;&gt;How can I use the resources?&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You may like to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send the resources around your team or directorate, including a link to this page&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;create space to discuss these resources at a team-meeting, away-day or in other relevant meetings&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;print out some copies of the resources to leave in the communal areas of your workplace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To highlight LGBTI+ legislation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Review LGBTI+ inequality and discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Explore the impact of COVID-19 on LGBTI+ people.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Consider what managers can do to support LGBTI+ colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;lgbti-legislation&quot;&gt;LGBTI+ Legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-equality-act-2010&quot;&gt;The Equality Act 2010&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Act considers sexual orientation, sex and gender reassignment as protected characteristics. Gender reassignment is considered a protected characteristic regardless of what point an individual is in the transition process. A person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment if the person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person’s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex. The law acts to prevent discrimination and harassment along with equal rights, opportunities and access to private and public services. So people are protected in work, education, and training, and able to access services such as health care but also goods, facilities and housing. Please see types of unlawful discrimination on the next slide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gender-recognition-act-2004&quot;&gt;The Gender Recognition Act 2004&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Act provides trans people with legal recognition in their ‘acquired’ gender. The individual does not have to undergo surgery nor have to commit to having surgery. Though, individuals must be 18 years old or above and:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;have had a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (a medical condition where one feels discomfort and distress because there is a dissonance between their body and mind)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;lived in their acquired gender for 2 years, such as going to work (this is called the Real Life Experience)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;one should intend to continue in their acquired gender until death&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In applying for gender recognition one has to send evidence from an array of people. This is then reviewed by a panel to decide if the person qualifies for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). The certificate then allows one to be treated in their reassigned gender for all practical and legal purposes such as marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once a person has a GRC they will be able to obtain a replacement birth certificate with their preferred (and now new legal) gender on it. Then, all legal rights and responsibilities will correspond to their legally updated gender.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The GRC is not a form of ID and it is unlawful to request a person’s GRC.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-unlawful-discrimination&quot;&gt;Types of unlawful discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct&lt;/strong&gt; – Unnecessarily requiring someone not to be LGBTI+.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirect&lt;/strong&gt; – Where LGBTI+ people are particularly disadvantaged by a
provision or some criteria which applies to everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By perception&lt;/strong&gt; – Where a person thinks someone is LGBTI+ (but they are not), and then discriminates against them because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By association&lt;/strong&gt; – Discrimination because of someone mixing with, or has an association with, LGBTI+ people/&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassment&lt;/strong&gt; – Acting in a way that violates the dignity of another person or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that person because they are LGBTI+. There is protection from less favourable treatment of a worker because they submit to, or reject sexual harassment or harassment related to sex or gender reassignment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victimisation&lt;/strong&gt; – It is unlawful to discriminate against someone because they have used the provisions of the legislation or have helped someone else to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;lgbti-inequality--discrimination&quot;&gt;LGBTI+ Inequality &amp;amp; Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite progressive legislation there is still ongoing homophobia, biphobia and transphobia…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LGBTI+ people still face discrimination disproportionately,&lt;/strong&gt; facing inequality at home and in work as well as in health care whilst also having higher rates of homelessness, substance abuse, and poor mental health. Discrimination and harassment can be verbal or physical abuse from strangers on the street, but there are cases where friends, family members and partners have harmed or even killed their LGBTI+ friends, family members or partners due to their sexuality and/or gender.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of transgender hate crimes recorded by police forces in England, Scotland and Wales has risen by 81%,&lt;/strong&gt; latest figures suggest. Data obtained by the BBC showed there were 1,944 crimes across 36 forces in the last financial year compared with 1,073 in 2016-17.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In July 2017, the Government launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report&quot;&gt;National LGBT Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to gather more information about the experiences of LGBT people in the UK. The survey response was unprecedented. Over 108,000 people participated, making it the largest national survey of LGBT people in the world to date. It statistics reported:
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;LGBT respondents are less satisfied with their life than the general UK population (rating satisfaction 6.5 on average out of 10 compared with 7.7). Trans respondents had particularly low scores (around 5.4 out of 10)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;More than two thirds of LGBT respondents said they had avoided holding hands with a same-sex partner for fear of a negative reaction from others&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;At least 2 in 5 respondents had experienced an incident because they were LGBT, such as verbal harassment or physical violence, in the 12 months preceding the survey. However, more than 9 in 10 of the most serious incidents went unreported, often because respondents thought ‘it happens all the time’&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;2% of respondents had undergone conversion or reparative therapy in an attempt to ‘cure’ them of being LGBT, and a further 5% had been offered it&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;24% percent of respondents had accessed mental health services in the 12 months preceding the survey&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;further-lgbti-inequality--discrimination&quot;&gt;Further LGBTI+ Inequality &amp;amp; Discrimination&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some statistics worsened through lockdown, with a significant impact on people’s mental health…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/how-covid-19-affecting-lgbt-communities&quot;&gt;Stonewall reported&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Almost a quarter of young people at risk of homelessness are LGBT, usually because their families reject them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;More than one in ten LGBT people have faced domestic abuse from a partner, rising to 19 per cent for trans people.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Already, two in five trans people experience a lack of understanding of their specific health needs when accessing general healthcare services. Now, they face delays or cancellations on essential gender-affirming treatment, which many have been waiting years to access.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lgbt.foundation/coronavirus/hiddenfigures&quot;&gt;LGBT Foundation reported&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;42% would like to access support for their mental health at this time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;8% do not feel safe where they are currently staying&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;18% are concerned that this situation is going to lead to substance or alcohol misuse or trigger a relapse&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;64% said that they would rather receive support during this time from an LGBT specific organisation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;16% had been unable to access healthcare for non-COVID-19 related issues&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;34% of people have had a medical appointment cancelled&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;23% were unable to access medication or were worried that they might not be able to access medication&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;30% increase in domestic abuse/violence calls to our helpline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;covid-19-impact&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With usual spaces, services and support disrupted due to COVID-19, this means that our LGBTI+ colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;May not feel safe at home due to living with LGBTI+-phobic family members or abusive partners, thereby wanting to go back to the office to access safety and support.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;May not have the privacy to access support or freedom to be themselves, therefore wanting to go back to the office to improve their mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Could be feeling overwhelmed and anxious about going back the office after being socially isolated for so long. They may need time to adjust and a phased return to the office.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Might be feeling safer at home as they are less at risk of verbal harassment or physical violence. Instead, working from home may actually be improving their mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During this time, the trans and intersex community have faced additional issues…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Recent debates in the media around the Gender Recognition Act have led to an increase in polarised positions, particularly in social media where there are fewer restrictions/standards preventing inflammatory comment. This persistent negative discourse on social media has had the effect on many trans people of undermining their confidence and security and caused substantial anxiety and distress.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The fear of hospitalisation to treat COVID-19, common to everyone, is heightened for some trans people who worry that they might be placed on single-sex wards that don’t match their gender, and also for intersex people with trauma/PTSD from previous encounters with medical professionals, with both groups having concerns about bodily privacy and dignity if hospitalised. Working from home instead however might mean an increase in exposure to this online transphobia for many trans and intersex colleagues, leaving them feeling stuck in a stressful no-win situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;support-for-lgbti-colleagues&quot;&gt;Support for LGBTI+ colleagues&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Manager support:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Employers have a duty of care to their employees. As more offices and workplaces reopen, line managers should conduct return to the workplace discussions with their team members. These can be followed by assessments of individual risk indicators to determine how and when employees may be able to return. This can also help identify and address actions needed to reduce any negative health and safety impacts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Further support:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Set up 1-2-1s to check ins - these could also be with a colleague or an LGBTI+ network member if that is easier for the individual, the focus should be on enabling communication.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Direct them to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/networks/&quot;&gt;Departmental Network&lt;/a&gt; - they have been providing drop in sessions, virtual catch ups and social events during COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Direct them to cross-government network – &lt;a href=&quot;https://agender.org.uk&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/&quot;&gt;CS LGBT+ Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Suggest that they contact a Mental Health First Aider – LGBT+ volunteers are available on our website if that makes them more comfortable (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/05/18/mhaw-tim&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/05/20/mhaw-kay&quot;&gt;Kay&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/05/20/mhaw-emily&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;scenario-1-member-of-staff-transitioning-and-living-alone&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Member of staff transitioning and living alone&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Despite trans people having to and wanting to live in ‘acquired’ gender, the visibility can cause issues in employment. Before COVID-19 this person was struggling with their appearance where they had to conceal or imply body parts as they have not had surgery or hormones yet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The response to their transition from their colleagues was mixed, with some making assumptions about their abilities and mis-gendering them. Some staff have treated the person differently even though their abilities have not changed. One or two others have been very supportive though, providing a safe space in the office for this person.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Now they are struggling with the impact of COVID-19 delaying their transition which was going to make them feel more comfortable in work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They are feeling isolated due to living alone but overwhelmed about going back out into society.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They are stressed and anxious about returning to the workplace fearing an increase in transphobia due to current media outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1-possible-outcome&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Possible outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This member of staff has a return to the workplace discussion with their line manager. They are reassured about the completed building and health &amp;amp; safety risk assessments.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As this person has a good relationship with their line manager, they complete the COVID-19 Individual Risk Indicator together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They agree that it will be good for them to ease back to the workplace by working from home for part of the week and staggering work hours so that they can commute during off peak hours.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The line manager also engaged with the LGBTI+ Network and HR as well as the supportive colleagues (with the person’s permission) to consider a managed approach which buddies the person with supportive colleagues and educates less supportive colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Their line manager encouraged them to work flexibly around cosmetic appointments that remedied their appearance which led to a reduction in their dysphoria and also the incidence of misgendering, improving their mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;scenario-2-member-of-staff-who-is-gay-and-living-with-homophobic-parents&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Member of staff who is gay and living with homophobic parents&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This person is out and proud at work, being an active member of their Departments LGBTI+ Network. They have a supportive colleagues so they enjoy going to work to socialise with people.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;However, at home they are not free to speak about their sexuality as they are told it is just a phase by their parents.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As they are unable to be themselves freely they are feeling very isolated.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;They don’t have much privacy as their parents are working from home too, so they don’t feel like they can attend virtual LGBTI+ events from home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Therefore, working from home in this environment is impacting on this person’s mental health. They would benefit from being in the office to access support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2-possible-outcome&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Possible outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During their return to the workplace discussion with their line manager, they establish that they can drive to the office and would be working at a location that has been reopened with stringent health and safety controls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Their COVID-19 Individual Risk Indicator shows that they are low risk and would benefit from returning to the workplace where a number of their colleagues have already returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;At work they will be safe to access support from their Department’s LGBTI+ organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The return process may involve changes in teams, buildings and shift patterns due to COVID-19 redeployment. It’s a known issue that LGBTI+ people are always coming out as they meet new colleagues. This could be a further issue to consider in your assessment if there are team moves and changes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Please consider all indictors of risk and how returning to the office will impact on the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Be mindful that one solution won’t fit all people’s needs, so treat each person individually and consider their different needs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As there may be variant and wider factors to consider, please work closely with HR and LGBTI+ Networks for support.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Speak and work with the individual to find a comfortable solution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/22/bi-tilly">&lt;p&gt;Happy bi visibility day! It’s a day which has been officially observed since 1999 to shine a spotlight on the bisexual community, its history, people and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-bisexuality&quot;&gt;Defining Bisexuality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sexuality exists on a spectrum and identities are complex and diverse one person’s bisexuality may differ from another’s. However a good standard definition which captures most bisexual people is:
‘The romantic and/or sexual attraction towards more than one sex or gender (including non-binary identities).’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-why-is-there-a-need-for-a-specific-day-of-visibility&quot;&gt;So why is there a need for a specific day of visibility?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst it is true that awareness and acceptance of LGBT+ identities is increasing there are still pervasive stereotypes and misinformation about bisexual people that range from nuisance misunderstandings to biphobia and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Stonewall study on LGBT+ identities in the workplace found that bisexual workers were less likely to be out to their co-workers than their gay and lesbian counterparts. A significant contributing factor to this was the fear of negative reactions from co-workers often stemming from pervasive stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at some, these are all quite common assumptions that either myself or fellow bisexuals have had to deal with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi people are responsible for spreading AIDS through to the straight population.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height HIV/AIDS epidemic bisexual people were one group scapegoated for spreading HIV to the straight population, but this has had a lasting impact. With hindsight and research of course it is obvious that a public health crisis is much more complicated than ‘it was the bisexuals that did it’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi people are just being greedy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi people are cheaters/ will leave you for a partner of a different gender.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stereotypes centre around the idea that because bisexual folk are attracted to multiple genders they must be promiscuous or never settled and happy with the relationship they’re in. On a private level it can make trust building difficult in relationships and outside the home it can invite many unwarranted advances and sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi people are only bi until they are with a partner then they are straight or gay.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi is just a coming-out-strategy for gay when you don’t want to commit all the way yet.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bi people can’t make their minds up/ It’s a phase”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting many of these stereotypes is the concept of Bi Erasure where the identities of bisexual people are ignored, forgotten or dismissed because they’re assumed to have the orientation of their partner or that it’s false and being done for attention, or ‘just a phase’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bi-erasure&quot;&gt;Bi Erasure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bi erasure can be damaging because it is denying someone their identity and authenticity. It is also damaging to the community as a whole when the identities of historical figures who we know were bisexual, or may have been bisexual, are erased and the community loses a figure to look up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freddie Mercury, for example, is popularly remembered by history as a closeted gay man but he was in fact openly bisexual to those close to him. Frida Kahlo’s identity is often compartmentalised, she remembered by some as a feminist icon, by others as a disabled icon, or by others as a bisexual icon and as a result the intersectionality of her entire identity is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence to suggest that figures including Tove Jansson, King James VI and I, and Winston Churchill may have all been bisexual having had relationships with both men and women throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debates that surround the sexuality of historical figures are often binary ‘they were closeted and wanted to protect their image’ or ‘they was straight it’s all hearsay’. But perhaps the actual sexuality of historical figures is not as important as the tone of the debate itself. There is often fierce will to conclude whether historical figures were either gay or straight, but this again just shows how frequently Bi identities are dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this bi-visibility day remember to look past stereotypes and that there is often more to someone’s sexuality than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bisexual is often used as an “umbrella term” that covers a few different identities.  Broadly it means being attracted, either romantically or physically, to more than one gender (yes, there are more than two, but that’s a different subject that is far too complicated to cover here!)  It’s important to respect someone’s own identity, so if they use a different definition, or a different word to mean a similar thing then that is what they are - accept it, don’t correct it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being visible means being acknowledged and allowed to exist.  There doesn’t have to be a party, just don’t pretend we don’t exist (although a party would be nice!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone’s sexuality isn’t dependant on their current partner, so someone who is in a committed relationship with one person can still be bi.  We don’t suddenly become heterosexual or gay just because of the person we’re with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bi is not a phase, or a half-way point.  Some people describe their sexuality as “fluid” meaning it changes and shifts over time, and that is equally valid but it doesn’t represent all people.  For many people being bi is a constant and unchanging thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see being bi as an absence rather than an active thing - sex or gender identity just isn’t a factor for me in how attractive I find someone.  It’s just another thing like hair colour or favourite food.  I find it hard to describe, because it’s all I know.  I honestly can’t imagine being attracted to people of a single gender, but I accept that is how some people feel.  Just like I don’t understand why some people don’t like cheese (I really do!) or some people do like cricket (I really don’t!), but I still accept that those tastes are real too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the thing I really don’t understand: it doesn’t matter to me whether someone likes cheese, or cricket, or not.  I don’t think things like that matter to most people, apart from maybe changing the topics of conversation, or where to have lunch (assuming any venues are open!). So why should it be so different with sexuality?  I like cheese, I don’t like cricket, and I’m bi. They’re all part of who I am, along with a whole load of other things.  You don’t have to share my tastes, just respect them, and accept that sometimes some aspects are more important than others.  Today, being bi is more important than cheese!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity can seem complicated, so whether you identify as something other than 100% heterosexual or just want to try to understand more, please consider joining the LGBT+ network.

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/20/bi-mark">&lt;h4 id=&quot;did-you-know-that-1-in-4-people-define-as-something-other-than-heterosexual&quot;&gt;Did you know that 1 in 4 people define as something other than heterosexual?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2015/08/16/half-young-not-heterosexual&quot;&gt;YouGov survey of the British public&lt;/a&gt; found that 23% of us experience some kind of attraction to the same, or more than one gender. This figure rose to 49% of 18-25 year olds; and as time goes by, more and more people are acknowledging that they fall somewhere in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;could-this-mean-that-between-a-quarter-and-half-of-all-fco-staff-might-be-somewhere-on-this-in-between-spectrum-too&quot;&gt;Could this mean that between a quarter and half of all FCO staff might be somewhere on this “in between” spectrum too?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly. But how can this be? No one seems to talk about this at work. Until recently, I never knew anyone who defined as “bisexual”. If this affects so many of us, why aren’t we open about it? As a bi+ member of staff, even I have never (until this blog) been open about my identity in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bi-people-are-all-around-but-you-may-never-have-noticed&quot;&gt;Bi+ people are all around, but you may never have noticed.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that bi+ people (people who experience attraction towards more than one sex, gender or gender identity)*, exist in all walks of life but we rarely feel safe enough to open up. This is partly because we are generally able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa6AnOCQD50&quot;&gt;“pass” in the heteronormative world&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, we have adapted to hide ourselves, in plain sight…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-and-mostly-people-make-assumptions-about-us-so-we-dont-get-heard&quot;&gt;… and mostly, people make assumptions about us, so we don’t get heard.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being confident in yourself at work doesn’t mean you have to suddenly become a card-carrying member of the LGBT community; in fact, there are so many average, every-day members of staff who quietly happen to have their own unique orientation somewhere on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we don’t fit under one label. Other times our orientation shifts over time. Many of us are in long term opposite-sex relationships, or define as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5026092/mostly-straight-sexual-identity-bisexual-gay/&quot;&gt;mostly straight&lt;/a&gt;”. All of these varieties and many more can fall under the bi+ umbrella.
But because of the assumption that everyone has to fit into narrowly defined categories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glaad.org/bisexual/bierasure&quot;&gt;people like us get erased&lt;/a&gt;. We fall between the cracks, existing in the margins, scared to speak up. For this reason, bi+ people are vulnerable to isolation and exclusion, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outlife.org.uk/we-need-to-talk-about-bisexual-mental-health&quot;&gt;anxiety, depression and even suicide&lt;/a&gt;, more so than other parts of the LGBT community.
Then, if we do dare to speak out, the assumptions begin. People think we’re promiscuous “experimenters”, others think we’re closeted homosexuals, or it’s “just a phase”. We are distrusted in relationships and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/miley-cyrus-bisexual-lgbt-lesbian-julie-bindel-transgender-a8900421.html&quot;&gt;almost completely unrepresented in popular culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-but-if-there-are-so-many-of-us-why-is-this-happening-to-us&quot;&gt;… but if there are so many of us, why is this happening to us?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bi+ people, we often don’t realise how many people there are just like us. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/media/lgbt-facts-and-figures&quot;&gt;40% of bi people do not feel safe to tell their work colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, compared to 7% of gay men and 4% gay women. But bi+ covers a huge range of different identities as well as those who chose not to identify at all.
So please, if you have ever felt like this: you are not alone. In fact, you’re the opposite of alone! There are literally millions of people around you who truly get it and are here to help. There is no one single “correct” identity. Sometimes your identity doesn’t make sense. That’s totally normal. 
And if you do happen to have an exclusive orientation – you are also not alone. You are surrounded by a brilliant, diverse set of colleagues and friends, many of whom will never tell you, but really appreciate your support. They’re your team-mates, managers, directors. You never know who might be impacted by a gesture of solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;to-access-help-or-support&quot;&gt;To access help or support…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you would like to talk to someone in confidence, with no judgement, please get in touch with &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:flagg@fco.gov.uk&quot;&gt;FLAGG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mark.smith4@fco.gov.uk&quot;&gt;Mark Smith&lt;/a&gt; (he/him)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re suffering from anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/&quot;&gt;please seek help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you feel brave enough to talk, do it. Every time we speak out, it makes it easier for someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that you are surrounded by friends and allies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t have to define as anything. You don’t have to understand your own mind. It doesn’t have to make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you experience abuse at work, there are confidential ways to report it (FCDO internal access only): &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=09Ci08h8Uk-7-YW9Q9lCeZ6PprWM9ZdDuVEk6rRc2ytUOE05NkRFME1MTFpEVE9MS09SUTJHOFNDRyQlQCN0PWcu&quot;&gt;BHDanonymousfeedbacktool&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.fco.gov.uk/hr/relations/Pages/first-response-officers.aspx&quot;&gt;First Response Officers&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.fco.gov.uk/hr/health/welfare/Pages/eap.aspx&quot;&gt;Employee Assistance Programme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s start the conversation. Get in touch with any views and/or comments on this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-would-like-to-help-others&quot;&gt;If you would like to help others…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be an ally. Tell people. Talk about it. Make it known. Support people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t assume somebody’s orientation or identity, no matter how sure you think you are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use inclusive language and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/faqs-and-glossary/glossary-terms&quot;&gt;read up on terminology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand up, if you can, to intolerant behaviour in the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear a rainbow lanyard this Pride season, it is a great statement of solidarity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inews.co.uk/opinion/comment/why-i-put-pronouns-in-my-email-signature-and-you-should-too-136421&quot;&gt;Include your pronouns&lt;/a&gt; on your email signature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’d like more information about how you can make a more inclusive workplace, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/straight_allies.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bi+ is an umbrella term which includes all those who experience attraction towards more than one sex, gender or gender identity. It includes bisexual, pansexual, non-defining, bi-curious and many more…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/19/bi-rebecca">&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Rebecca Hobson and I work in Sheffield for the Planning, Innovation, Excellence &amp;amp; Strategy Team. I have been open about my sexuality for just over a year, after 5 years of only being open with my husband and a few close friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me being open created a lot of dialogue between myself, friends and family and I very quickly realised that many of the people I spoke to have no idea that bisexuality existed. I had found it easy to fade into the background for so long and not speak out about my sexuality as it never felt as though it was something anyone would take seriously. It was never talked about at home or on tv/ media in a positive way. I always felt as though bisexual people were promiscuous, confused or that they should “pick a side” which in turn gave me internalised biphobia and if I couldn’t accept me, how was anyone else going to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bi visibility day creates a safe space for bisexual people to talk about how they feel and creates conversation with those who do not identify as bisexual. These conversations can help to educate people on the issue’s bisexual people may face and highlight them to the vast spectrum of bisexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being myself in public and among family and friends, gave me so much confidence, I had no idea just how much I was hiding myself from everyone I knew. Many friends have asked me why as a married woman, I felt the need to come out? The answer is very simple, I was walking around day to day, wearing a mask and not fully knowing who I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bi visibility highlighted these issues and I learned of events that were for other people feeling the exact same way I was. I began talking to other bisexual people in groups and on forums and I finally felt like I understood who I was, which in turn gave me the confidence to come out to everyone. In general, most aspects of my life have not changed but my emotional/ mental well-being has improved greatly, I am a much happier person and I believe I have bi visibility to thank for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get in touch with the Home Office LGBT+ Network &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:spectrum@homeoffice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;SPECTRUM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<published>2020-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2020-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/17/bi-becks">&lt;p&gt;Bisexual. Bi. What comes to mind? Greedy, unfaithful, fence sitter, can’t make your mind up, straight girl just playing at it, straight guy who’s really gay; I never quite understood the frequent mantra I would hear that bi guys were really gay and bi girls were really straight – hint of misogyny or titillation perhaps? I’ve been accused of all of the above. But I’m a bisexual woman. Also a little odd that I am blogging about who I have intimate relationships with – straight people don’t do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know from Civil Service People Survey data that the employment experience for bisexual civil servants is different from that of their lesbian, gay and straight colleagues. Bisexual civil servants are more likely to experience bullying, harassment or discrimination and are less well represented in SCS feeder grades, along with those who identify their sexual orientation as ‘other’. We also know that bisexual people are less likely to be open about their sexuality and it means that there is very little visibility of bisexual people in the Civil Service. Certainly, I haven’t met another openly bisexual senior civil servant in my time (and due to vetting rules back in the day very few who were openly LGBT+ at all) and I didn’t see any as I was moving up – maybe they were there, but they were certainly not visible. We are also doing research around why bi colleagues experience these issues in particular, and what more we should do to address them, therefore we are launching the Bi Survey which all colleagues in DIT who identify as Bi are encouraged to complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;access-the-dit-bi-survey-here&quot;&gt;Access the DIT Bi Survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://ditresearch.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0O0biULn95pEcxT&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe for this reason I’ve hesitated to own the label over the years (except with my vetting officer – I have held DV security clearance for over 20 years). I’m fast approaching 50 and in my time, I have had long term relationships with all genders (perhaps I should use the label pansexual, but that’s a whole different story). The last few years I have used queer and bisexual interchangeably. But I have also allowed the assumption of lesbian when in a relationship with a woman and straight when in a relationship with a man. Also I pass. For the initiated that means that no-one would look at me and think I’m a lesbian. People don’t yell dyke at me when walking down the street (well not since I stopped going through my short hair/Doc Martins phase – which was a few years ago). I carry all the privileges of a straight white woman. Except when out with my non-binary partner and then they are often eroded. I have to think twice before reaching out to hold their hand and confirm it is safe – straight people don’t generally to do that in the UK. And we do still have abuse hurled at us. In villages in sleepy Kent and in central London. Homophobia is not yet dead I’m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;so-why-now-and-why-does-bi-visibility-dayweek-matter-to-me&quot;&gt;So why now? And why does bi-visibility day/week matter to me?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of DIT’s LGBT+ champions (the other two are Claire Vince and Gavin Winbanks), it is really important to me that people can look up and see someone that is a bit like them. Visibility is important. I want the Civil Service to be a diverse and inclusive place to work and that includes those for whom bisexual is part of their identity. The LGBT+ SCS Champions and the Network are there to support anyone who identifies as LGBTQ+, so please do &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:lgbtnetwork@trade.gov.uk&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; for more information or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becks&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/17/bi-ccs">&lt;p&gt;Bi Awareness Week takes place every year from 16 September, ending with Bi Visibility Day on the 23rd. According to Wikipedia, this event is “a call to recognise and celebrate bisexual history, bisexual community and culture, and all the bisexual people in their lives”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, Pride in CCS would be holding events and talks along with our colleagues in other government departments — but what does ‘recognising and celebrating’ actually look like now, with everyone continuing to work from home for the foreseeable future? How can we recognise each other, when we haven’t even seen each other in person for six months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem a little odd to have a Bi Awareness Week at all – after all, what’s there to be ‘aware’ of, really? Bi people – those of us who are attracted to both people of our own gender AND people with a different gender – were one of the later groups to be added to the ‘alphabet soup’ of the LGBTQ+ acronym, and often we can be among the less visible, because we’re perceived as gay when we’re in a same-sex relationship, and straight when we’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nobody thinks that someone in a monogamous relationship loses the ability to be attracted to anyone else, ever – and in the same way, a bisexual person in an apparently ‘straight’ relationship doesn’t stop being bi! I normally describe it as the exact opposite of supporting a football team – we’re choosing a person, not choosing a side. And isn’t that what anyone who falls in love does, really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;misconceptions&quot;&gt;Misconceptions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is perhaps the most common misconception about bi people I’ve heard repeated, there are many more – that we’re greedy or untrustworthy, we’re ‘just experimenting’, that we can’t be faithful, that we’re ‘not really LGBTQ+’ – and the aim of Bi Awareness Week is to give people a chance to talk about these ideas, and to counter them by discussing them openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody can be expected to know everything, or to understand what they’ve never encountered before. Honest questions are not offensive, and absolutely beat the stuffing out of uncritically repeating stereotypes! As they say, the best disinfectant is daylight – and the best way to know what bi people are really like is by actually getting to know us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, hi. If you haven’t met me before – I’m Bethan, I work for the User Research &amp;amp; Design Team, I’m vice chair of CCS’s LGBTQ+ Network, I’m a massive superhero and science fiction nerd… and I’m bi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not necessarily asking to be celebrated (although it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; my birthday on Monday, so you can if you like!), but if there’s anything you want to know, please feel absolutely free to reach out and ask. Alternatively, if you’d like to know more, or would like support, Pride In CCS meet over Hangouts once a month – whether you identify as LGBTQ+ or as an ally, we’d love to have you as a member! Please contact me or our network chair, Dan Page, to join us.

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/16/bi-diana-welsh-government">&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I was appointed Bi Champion on the Welsh Government PRISM Board. Apparently, I am the first Bi Champion here at the Welsh Government. Did you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are full of surprises and I am betting almost no one noticed that I am Bi. Only a few of you will have spotted that I am also a long-term monogamist. It’s just how I am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may sound odd but in a way, I am Bi by accident. My Autism (don’t tell me you hadn’t spotted that?!) means that I can’t ‘see’ what gender people are. Of course, not all people with Autism have this difficulty. Every person is unique but we all have humanness in common. I am delighted to celebrate our differences and raise the profile of Bi-visibility Day, as a member of the PRISM Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since becoming Bi Champion, I have been able to facilitate a strategic workshop for board members to create a business plan - to complement our already fabulous communications work. I also helped create some bi-information materials. You can access some of these materials at the bottom of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to talk to other Bi people internally in Welsh Government (in confidence), so that I can better represent your views. It is impossible to know who is who, so I am hoping that, as word gets around, a few of you will come and find me for a chat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also keen to learn from Bi Champions from other organisations, inside and outside Wales, so please feel free to introduce me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bi-visibility Day is on Wednesday 23 September this year, and the Bi+ Inclusion Team will be hosting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bisectionality-tickets-121350088381&quot;&gt;virtual conversation on intersectionality in the bi+ community&lt;/a&gt; so please come along for a chat!&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/10/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What happened at our latest Leaders of Networks Forum" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/10/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout">&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Departmental Network Leads and network members who joined our Leaders of Networks forum on Thursday 30th July. As always it was a useful discussion and it was great to hear how everyone has adapted to support their members over the past few months. 
Please find below a brief note of the meeting. The team will be in contact with attendees to follow up on any actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prideon-2020&quot;&gt;PrideON 2020&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network thanked all members and volunteers for their invaluable contribution to PrideON. The group spoke about the success of the month and its reach to all Civil Servants. The group were shown the ‘Virtual Parade’ which provided an overview to all the activities that took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-points-of-discussion&quot;&gt;Future points of discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group split into breakout rooms to discuss areas of discussion for future forums. This is to ensure the forum is best utilised as a space for problem solving and sharing best practice. A full list of discussion points will be distributed in advance of the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flags&quot;&gt;Flags&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the use of different flags across the public and private sector, noting the increased use of the ‘Progress Pride Flag’. It was discussed how the progress flag better represented people of colour and the trans community. CSLGBT+ Network advised that departments are to be guided by their own networks on what flags to use – as long as they can provide reassurance that the flag is not controversial and/or will not cause offence to any parts of the community. The Network will look into wider Civil Service communications on using the updated progress flag.
The group were also updated on the work taking place between the BEIS LGBT+ Network and the CSLGBT+ Network, where they have been delivering awareness sessions focused on LGBT+ history and the breakdown of the pride progressive flag. This has opened conversation to what individuals identify with, why we should have this flag and how this will challenge discrimination in our community. Feedback from attendees have been overwhelmingly positive and the CSLGBT+ Network is looking to deliver similar sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gra&quot;&gt;GRA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum discussed the upcoming response to the Gender Reform Act. Both the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a:gender Network continues to support its trans members during this time. If you have any specific queries on this, please email us directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cs-reform-shaping-our-future&quot;&gt;CS Reform/ Shaping our future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum discussed the launch of the ‘Shaping our future’ prospectus at Civil Service Live. As Civil Service LGBT+ networks, we have an opportunity to provide our collective views to the modernisation and reform team to ensure that diversity and inclusion, specifically LGBTI+ diversity and inclusion, are integral parts of the ‘Shaping our future’ programme. 
The network advised they would be coordinating a central response from our network to the prospectus, but encouraged all networks to send their own response to the consultation to strengthen our views, and where relevant, lobby the ‘reform champions’ in your organisations to bring these views to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;network-survey&quot;&gt;Network survey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network updated the group on the upcoming planned network survey. The purpose of this survey is to take a temperature check on how we as a network are performing, get some insight on what you’d like to see more or less of, and create a strong evidence base of your views on key workplace issues so that we can more effectively lobby CSHR and other key stakeholders for the changes our membership would like to see. The outcome will be our refreshed strategy with the key priority areas we will have identified.
We plan to run a consultation with network chairs on the skeleton of the survey, which we hope to circulate to you all in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diversity-and-inclusion-awards&quot;&gt;Diversity and Inclusion Awards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the launch of the CS D&amp;amp;I awards and encouraged departmental networks and members to nominate LGBT+ colleagues to recognise the invaluable work they have been doing across the Civil Service in promoting Diversity and Inclusion. The group raised the visibility of the awards across the Civil Service, since some had not heard about them through their departmental communication channels. The network has taken this away as an action to the CS D&amp;amp;I team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aob&quot;&gt;AOB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network has published an Asexual factsheet and resources for allies. The forum was invited to suggest future factsheets that the network could produce and distribute to Civil Servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks Forum is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network, it exists to share news of what the Civil Service LGBT+ Network is doing and to give departmental LGBT+ network leaders a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

This included a video of civil servants talking about the micro behaviours they experience which make them feel excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are real civil servants, talking about their real experiences - the sorts of things that civil servants are experiencing right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the video, and encourage colleagues to take a look, to understand some of the everyday behaviours which impact on LGB&amp;amp;TI people in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/27/kelly-cowley-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;kelly-cowley-is-a-national-insurance-interviewing-officer-at-the-oxford-job-centre-department-for-work-and-pensions&quot;&gt;Kelly Cowley is a National Insurance Interviewing Officer at the Oxford Job Centre (Department for Work and Pensions).&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me being a LGBT+ Ally means to stand alongside my colleagues in their fight for equality and inclusion. To stand up and be counted and to challenge some of the negative behaviours that I see around me. I have always held a strong belief that people have the right to be heard and as an Ally, I feel proud (yes that word) to be able to lend my support to my colleagues and play an active part in the great work they are doing – in not only educating others but also ensuring that everyone can rightly feel they can ‘Be me in DWP’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I have helped at a couple of events in regards to DWPride (DWPride being the departments support group for LGBT+ colleagues and their allies) and on the whole have been impressed at how most people have embraced these events. Just over a year ago I was given the task of arranging an event, which was to bring the different teams and sections in my area together.
Along with the work based sessions, to ensure all sections were represented I was really keen to have a session dedicated to DWPride and its role within the department as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached Mark Lambert, the local DWPride officer to see if this was something that he would be happy to do. Of course, he was more than happy but did warn me that I may face some opposition as not everyone was on-board with what DWPride meant or stood for.
So at various planning meetings I gave my reasons for wanting these sessions, explained how important they were and how they would not only help personal and group Inclusivity and equality it was also essential that new starters as well as more established colleagues understood what DWP Pride stood for and how they could get involved – or access resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event went very well and so many people said how much they enjoyed the session that Mark presented – how they now had a better understanding what DWPride is, why it is needed and of some of the issues faced within and by the LGBT+ community: and how they could play a part in ensuring that discrimination and negative behaviours could be challenged constructively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the mood is, thankfully, changing in relation to equality and inclusion and while there is some way to go, it does seem to be changing for the better and I will be there supporting everyone on this journey&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/21/sharon-lewis-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;sharon-lewis-is-the-deputy-chief-operating-officer-for-the-insolvency-service&quot;&gt;Sharon Lewis is the Deputy Chief Operating Officer for the Insolvency Service&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Sharon, what does it feel like to be the only heterosexual at the table? That was the question lobbed at me like a hand grenade during lunch about 5 years ago. At first, it made me quite cross - this was said to me by a friend of 30 years acquaintance in the presence of one of best friends, both of whom are members of the LGBT+ community. But it is only lately that I have come to understand why that challenge was perfectly fair and reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us go back to the 1980s to find out why. When I joined what was the Official Receiver’s office in 1985, girls were girls and boys were most definitely boys. It was a predominately white male environment and when you are a ‘young slip of a thing’ as I was once called, you tended to keep your head down a bit until you fathomed out how to fit in. That fitting in, as others recently commented on John Willis’s trip down memory lane blog, often meant long lunches in drinking clubs (that never shut in the afternoon) and engaging in ‘banter’. Not everyone of course said what would be considered now highly inappropriate, it was just no one ever gave it a second thought, it was the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a particularly devastating time for the gay community with all the stigmatisation of HIV/AIDS to cope with, not to mention the death of so many loved ones – and some people who held such prejudiced and bigoted views could not help themselves but blame that whole community for wreaking havoc on the rest of us ‘innocents’. It’s a word that was said more than once to me as my first (late) husband was battling cancer brought on by AIDS which he contracted through his treatment of haemophilia with infected blood products. But try as I might to put them right, very few people listened back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no support network or allies for people to turn to back then, they either had to ‘grin and bear it’ or just not join in at all and be labelled a loner. The few ladies who worked across the insolvency profession had their own network. The work hard, play hard cliché was right in one respect (no prizes for guessing which half!) when we would get together after work for a good old-fashioned girls night out. When the conversation inevitably turned to who was dating who, there was, I hate to admit it now, probably an unsaid rule, that was always a male/female pairing, so what must my friend who was so kind and so much fun, have felt at the table, no doubt wanting to tell us about her girlfriend, but thinking it best not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How different it is now, if not worldwide where there is still some persecution, but at least here. In June/Pride month, it feels so much more inclusive. If anyone has not seen the 2014 film ‘Pride’, now is the time to get acquainted. It will make you laugh, clap and cry all at the same time. I am proud to be a LGBT+ ally. It’s not just about wearing a rainbow coloured lanyard, it is about creating the right environment so people can feel welcome, secure, and happy to bring their whole selves to work, not hide away part of themselves as happened in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to answer the question posed at the start of this blog – how does it feel?  It feels good, very good indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/17/emj-dyall-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;emj-dyall-is-the-co-friends-lead-of-environment-agencys-lgbt-network&quot;&gt;Emj Dyall is the Co-Friends Lead of Environment Agency’s LGBT+ Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine living with fear, not just for yourself but your own children as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a heterosexual, cisgender woman and my pronouns are she/her. I am an ally to LGBT+ people because I, like many others, have LGBT+ friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a same-sex household and have seen the toil and hardship my family experienced as a result of their harmless love. As a child, I was forced to hide my family, and lie to my friends about them because they were scared that I would be subjected to bullying and harassment by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grew up, I noticed how wrong it was to hide the people I love and so I am now open and vocal, fighting for LGBT+ rights. Sharing my experiences is my way of being an effective ally, but being an effective ally is as simple as being open in your support LGBT+ people and their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that we are loud in our support and love for each other – especially now. Lockdown poses problems for many people who identify as LGBT+ and struggle to be accepted by their family. Being forced to remain indoors around people that don’t accept you for who you are can be traumatising. Consider the transgender community for example, who may be regularly called the name they went by before they transitioned (dead-named) by their family and loved ones, perhaps even intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As allies, we set an example for others to follow; to show respect and tolerance to the people around us. We show a united front against people who discriminate against LGBT+ people, and we celebrate freedom, equality and love. This is important because the battles LGBT+ people face are never-ending – fighting for equal rights and to end stigmas against the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be ‘loud’ with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you also celebrate freedom, equality and love, and are willing to show a united front against people who discriminate against LGBT+ people, why not join your department’s LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also consider adding pronouns to your email signatures to normalise the provision of them, and include people that identify outside of gender norms or as genders that were not assigned to them at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already a friend of your network, encourage others to join too – together we can grow and become and incredible show of support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My allyship is a promise to LGBT+ people.  It is an offer of love and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the commitment to willingly use my time and energy to understand historical and present-day hatred, violence and discrimination towards LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the guarantee that I will listen to you in order to understand your lived experiences.  It is the desire to read, listen to, see and be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the promise that I will use that learning to help build a more inclusive life, workplaces and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will carry my allyship with me wherever I go and you will be able to see it and hear it wherever I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will speak out against phobic behaviours, cultures and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will critically analyse the policies, practices and outputs of my employer, and work to understand and respond to potential and current developments in society and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will work hard to educate fellow straight people and to help others to become allies. I will celebrate you, support you, and defend you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will do my best to never let you down. I am hugely proud to be with you

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/15/leah-cunnah-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;leah-cunnah-is-a-vice-chair-of-the-civil-service-lgbt-network-and-a-policy-officer-in-the-education--skills-funding-agency-within-the-department-for-education&quot;&gt;Leah Cunnah is a Vice-Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a Policy Officer in the Education &amp;amp; Skills Funding Agency within the Department for Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ‘ally’ describes people who support and act to advance LGBT+ equality. Cisgender and straight people cannot understand how LGBT+ people have felt and experienced discrimination. However, we can recognise that and then educate ourselves, challenge others, raise awareness, volunteer time, listen to the community, be visible, and use our voices to help make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became passionate about tackling inequality following studying LGBT+ history and legislation in university. I decided to use my Master’s dissertation to voice trans people’s stories as they have been silenced through history. I wanted to do more than just write about social change, so I volunteered with a LGBT+ youth group to support young people facing discrimination at home and school. This led to me delivering sessions in schools to tackle LGBT+ stereotypes and bullying, then being the volunteer coordinator for Liverpool Pride where I was able help others celebrate and raise awareness. Now as a Vice-Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network I want to help make a difference in my own workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in times where it is no longer enough to just say you are an ally. We need to challenge discriminative language and behaviour to speak up for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are socialised into ‘acceptable’ forms of sexuality and gender from birth. This continues in childhood and adulthood as we live in a binary society. Heteronormative language and behaviours are learnt, but as they are omnipresent (widespread/universal) they appear ‘natural’. Heteronormative discourse is re/produced everywhere in society from girls wearing pink and boys wearing blue to having gendered marriage roles, jobs and toilets. Michel Foucault (1990, P5) wrote, “We will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: nothing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, an interruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within reality, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power will be required”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always brought up by my parents to be accepting of others. Never did they predict that it would it result in me educating them to be even more progressive and challenging their language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown up in the generation where it has become acceptable to use the phrase, “That’s gay.” I cannot say I am innocent of this, as I remember using it in a bowling alley when I was a little girl. I was naive to its offense, but my Dad explained to me why I should not use it. That was a key moment in my life when I understood the impact of my words. Again, as a little girl I remember being with my Mum at an event with family friends, where the friend she was speaking to was upset. I hugged him and he got more upset. As a gay man, he had faced continuous stigma and unfair treatment, so my kindness was surreal to him. My point is, if a young child can learn from a mistake and be kind to someone regardless of their sexuality or gender, why can’t adults?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still hear people use, “That’s gay” - even people who support LGBT+ rights. Homophobia is so deep routed and normalised that people do not realise the negative annotations this attaches to people who are gay. We must remember that language is powerful, and our words have an impact. People would find it less comfortable if a word were used that attacked their identity. There are so many descriptive words people can use instead, so it is important to keep challenging language and educating others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often spoke with people about LGBT+ issues where they have used harmful or outdated language, not to be cruel or discriminative, but because they did not know them words were inappropriate or had changed. We are all human and all make mistakes, but we can recognise it and educate ourselves. Language is changing and evolving, so we are all bound to slip up. Even the word ‘queer’ which was once negative slur, has now been reclaimed by the LGBT+ community to celebrate diversity and difference. Therefore, it is vital that we educate each other to help society be a better place.

&lt;p&gt;When I look around at the world recently, I am truly saddened. I read the news and it feels like there is no good news, but despite there being a lot of sadness and heartache, I see glimpses of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June was Pride month and one of the many reasons I love being an ally. I am sad this year I will not be able to dance in the street with friends and celebrate alongside the LGBT+ community, but fingers crossed I can next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined GLEAM, the Government Internal Audit Agency’s LGBT network, as an ally to show my support for the community. At 23 my friend came out to me and I felt so honoured that he chose me to confide in. I have listened to the stories of his dates, danced alongside him in gay clubs, and been on double dates with him and his boyfriend. My friend found it easy coming out to his friends, but I know his family still don’t understand it, and unfortunately that is the case for many. This is another reason I am an ally; I want to help open people’s eyes and help them understand that love is love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Great Aunt has been with her partner for around 25 years and she came out at a time where people were still very negative about same sex partnerships. I can’t speak for her, but I think she did not always feel part of the family. I am lucky enough to have my aunts around in London and I go for regular walks and lunches with them. Their relationship is so normal to me it is hard to imagine anyone not accepting it. As an ally it is my job to challenge those who do not accept it and help those people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have faith for the coming years that raising awareness for the LGBT+ community will be easier as more people come accept it, but as an ally I must continue raising awareness, continue speaking out for my LGBT+ friends and family. Being an ally means showing support, challenging homophobia, biphobia, transphobia etc. If you want to be a good ally you need to think about the people who are close to you, we need to challenge the harsh comments or jokes people make as they are personal to our friends, family, and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am proud to be an ally and I hope I can encourage more people to stand with our LGBT+ friends and family.

In each episode we’ll be chatting to inspiring LGBT+ civil servants about pride, work and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 6 of the podcast is now available&lt;/strong&gt;. You can download it from wherever you get podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, John Peart – former vice-chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network – talks to Kate Hughes, the current chair of the Network. Kate works in the Cabinet Office as part of Civil Service HR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and Kate talk about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what the Network would usually have been doing to organise for Pride&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another year as an ally…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Naomi Diver, I am a freshwater ecologist but more importantly, an Area Friends rep for the LGBT+ network at the Environment Agency (EA). This is my third year being involved in the supporting the aims of the network. I will admit whilst being an ally all my life it was only once I got involved in the network, did I start to see that I could be doing a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since starting my formal role, I have supported the network in a vast variety of ways such as attending local Prides and Trans awareness training, helping organise awareness events such as IDAHOBIT, proof reading emails/resources and dabbling in logo design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most enlightening thing to happen to me this year was being able to attend a truly fantastic Stonewall allies training day, which brought together allies from different parts of the business - from HR, area &amp;amp; national operations, to team leaders and upper Management. The attendee’s previous experience ranged from reasonably knowledgeable to openly unfamiliar. The training covered LGBT+ terminology, issues, obstacles and what we can do to help. I found the atmosphere very welcoming and extremely non-judgemental; the training was comprehensive and provoked a lot of discussion. Leaving the training I felt truly honoured to have met so many passionate, interesting fellow allies. I really look forward to keeping in contact with them to ensure we all maintain our active outlooks and continue to contribute to making the workplace a welcoming and understanding environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My proudest moment (so far) this year…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the ongoing pandemic, Pride events all over the world have been cancelled this summer. However, technology is an amazing thing and this year the Environment Agency hosted a national week-long virtual pride event during pride month. I jumped at the chance to help create a rainbow version of a banner on our internet homepage. I felt this was something I was able to easily contribute towards, after several asks of logo/design help over the years. On the Monday of Pride week, I nervously clicked on the internet logo. I was warned that it might not work, the computer may say “NO” to any fiddling on the complex homepage. But to my joy there it was on my computer screen… which meant that everyone in the whole Environment Agency was being met with a temporary rainbow for a whole week. I felt proud that a very small effort on my part (approximately an hour) would hopefully make people in the EA feel seen, supported and understood, whilst also raising awareness of the activities going on during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not check out if there are any virtual pride events going on that you can join in? Or in these self-evaluating times, try to read and educate yourself about all minority communities, be it LGBT+, BAME, disability or health related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us all be honest; we all need a little bit of rainbow in our lives at the moment.

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/09/paul-kett-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;paul-kett-is-the-director-general-for-the-higher-education-and-further-education-group-at-the-department-for-education&quot;&gt;Paul Kett is the Director General for the Higher Education and Further Education Group, at the Department for Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many things these past months, Pride has looked and felt very different this year, shifting to primarily online events – and given the rich LGBT+ culture we have, film, music and literature seem to have played an even more important role this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an ally these events are important – personally they provide moments for me to connect with those who are LGBT+ and to understand the good, the bad and indifferent of peoples experiences, and generally to improve my own understanding of LGBT+ colleagues working at DfE. These events also provide an opportunity for me to signal my support – both at the events and in talking about them with colleagues afterwards. So in the absence of being able to ‘turn up’, I turn to a blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My allyship has focused on helping ensure DfE is a truly inclusive and supportive place, so everyone can be themselves at work. Though in our current context of our all working from home has shown a new challenge – and the importance of considering that to be truly inclusive at work is more than about our place of work. I’ve found some LGBT+ colleagues for whom being at home during this period has been incredibly difficult as their home environment is not one where they can be themselves, or they don’t have access to the community that gives them support. Indeed for some it was that work was a place where they could be themselves and that social element of the workplace has been hugely missed. And so it is more important than ever that we are supporting one another – and it is something I have been immensely proud of the way colleagues across DfE have been checking in with one another, and providing a kind and supportive place to chat even when that has to be on a teams or phone call rather than in person.&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/08/emma-hope-allyship" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma Hope: Speaking a more inclusive language avoids alienating someone from a conversation" />

			<updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/08/allies-emma-hope</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/08/emma-hope-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;emma-hope-is-the-chair-of-the-lgbt-allies-network-at-public-health-england&quot;&gt;Emma Hope is the Chair of the LGBT+ Allies Network at Public Health England&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Black Lives Matter protests I was struck by the number of people I heard saying, ‘but what can I actually do to help?’. So when asked if I would like to write an LGBT+ Ally blog, I wanted to give you a couple of actionable examples. And as no one person is defined by one characteristic, maybe it will help on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My number one easiest thing to do is to add your preferred pronouns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why&quot;&gt;‘what are my pronouns?’&lt;/a&gt; to the bottom of your email signature. For example, mine says ‘My preferred pronouns are she/her’ on a new line. Or you can incorporate them into your contact details, ‘telephone/email/pronouns’, so people know how to refer to you when they call or email. This is a clear and visible step you can take which shows you understand that you can’t judge someone’s gender by their name or looks. Only they can tell you how they prefer to be referred to. It may feel weird, especially if no one else in your office does it, and it may feel like you’re sticking your neck out, but if that is how you feel about stating something that you’re comfortable with others knowing, imagine how it feels for someone who isn’t? Your email signature tells the world how to connect to you, and so it is a great place to be explicitly referencing your pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing is to think about your language. Speaking a more inclusive language avoids alienating someone from a conversation. This is harder and requires a more sustained effort, and I know I do and I will continue to make mistakes. Consider, instead of woman or man, could you say person? Instead of mother or father, could you say parent? Instead of boyfriend or girlfriend, could you say partner, or spouse, or date? By minimising the gender in your speech, you allow the space for more people to connect with you. For a more detailed read on gendered language see &lt;a href=&quot;https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/gender-inclusive-language&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this, it’s not about creating a society where no one has a gender, referring to everyone as they/them/their. It is about creating a society where every gender belongs, and people can recognise themselves in your stories, anecdotes and examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more inclusive language often breaks down other barriers too. For example, saying ‘people in business’ instead of ‘businessman’ reduces the stereotype that business is for men. Talking about ‘parental leave’ rather than ‘maternity leave’ relieves the pressure that mothers will stay home to look after children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final action is to add educating yourself about LGBT+ issues to your learning and development objective. As an Ally, it is really important to spend time listening to other people’s stories, since your own is not so relevant. By adding this to your L&amp;amp;D objective you can justify spending 10 minutes every lunchtime reading an article, or an hour a week reading LGBT+ testimonies. The Civil Service aims to be the most inclusive employer, and we all know it has some way to go. But the Civil Service is you, and so if you become more inclusive you will be helping the Civil Service on its way to achieve that goal. You may even have an LGBT+ network you could help with as well, or why not set up an LGBT+ Allies network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not be easy, and you may feel discouraged along the way. If you do, I’d love for you to get in touch with me, and by sharing our passion we can inspire each other to be the Ally Army that the LGBT+ networks need. Contact the &lt;a href=&quot;info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/a&gt; and they will put you in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/07/emma-dunn-allyship" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma Dunn: Don't buy the grapes" />
			<published>2020-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2020-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/07/allies-emma-dunn</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/07/emma-dunn-allyship">&lt;h4 id=&quot;emma-dunn-is-the-chair-of-agender&quot;&gt;Emma Dunn is the Chair of a:gender.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t buy the grapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was around 5 years old when my mum introduced me to the concept of racism. We were in a supermarket and I was pestering her to buy me some grapes. She looked at the grapes and explained she wasn’t prepared to buy them because they came from South Africa, a country where (during Apartheid) the government treated their black citizens horribly - and that some of the money from the grapes would go to these “bad people”. I remember being confused by the idea that black people could be targeted because of their skin colour but also pleased by the idea that we could oppose it, even though we were white and lived thousands of miles away in Scotland. I was also cheesed off cos I really wanted the grapes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve always had an awareness of the importance of being an ally, although thanks to the privileges I enjoy, it took me a while to realise discrimination was everywhere. I worked with a lesbian manager in my first student job and adored her – I was horrified when she explained how much abuse she was regularly subjected to. I saw first-hand how much subtle racism my best friend had to endure and started to understand how my white skin insulated me. After my younger sister was diagnosed with a debilitating form of arthritis, I noticed how she struggled to get around in a world geared towards the able-bodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was intersex, it was the prejudice directed at LGBT people that started to feel horribly close to home. Once I understood that my body wasn’t binary, it seemed especially wrong to discriminate against people who also didn’t fit neatly into binary, heteronormative and cis-normative ideas about who they were or who they loved. That feeling has only increased as I have learned more. Heteronormative, cis-normative, and binary cultural and societal ideas damage us all, regardless of whether we are LGBTI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, I am still learning about the more nuanced types of prejudice and discrimination within our own LGBTI community. Bi-phobia and bi-erasure are still disappointingly prevalent. We see people trying to position trans rights as if they are in opposition to women’s rights. Too often the voices of people with less privilege are less audible (people of colour, trans people and women). Within the Civil Service we can still struggle to overcome unconscious bias, particularly around grade, disability and part-time hours. This is why I think it’s so important that the CSLGBT+ and a:gender networks continue to work together to examine these issues; even within our community we are so diverse that we must be vigilant to ensure we remain inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the fabulous Kerry Washington; “We can’t say that we believe in each other’s fundamental humanity and the turn a blind eye to the reality of each other’s existence and the truth of each other’s hearts. We must be allies and we must be allies in this business because to be represented is to be humanized and as long as anyone, anywhere is made to feel less human, our very definition of humanity is at stake and we are all vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now realise more than ever that, just like my parents, my values are not a passive thing but something I need to live every day and stand up for. The question is how can I consciously make a positive difference, just as my mum consciously chose to take a stand when I was a child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not always easy or comfortable. I have been challenged about the way I think and the assumptions I sometimes make but it’s essential to listen and ensure that we express our values in our actions every day. It is important from a moral and ethical point of view, but it’s also business-critical; having more diversity of thought and opinion within your organisation makes your organisation more flexible, resilient and innovative. It is why the Civil Service has an ambition to be the most inclusive employer in the UK; we want to be the best. We deserve it, and so do the communities we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an ally is not just about the big acts (disclaimer; marching at Pride is still amazing) but the little things too. There are endless ways to recognise, support and include all your LGBTI colleagues. This week I would challenge you to find ways to evolve your allyship. You could start by joining the CSLGBT+ and a:gender networks and finding out more about the more nuanced issues that affect your LGBTI colleagues. We are proud to work together to support LGBTI people across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember; don’t buy the grapes!&lt;/p&gt;

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/06/introducing-new-allies-resources/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing our new resources for allies" />
			<published>2020-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2020-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/06/new-allies-resources</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/06/introducing-new-allies-resources/">&lt;p&gt;To mark the end of Pride Month, in which the theme was allyship, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, in partnership with the Cabinet Office is pleased to launch our &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/allies-resources&quot;&gt;resources for allies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-use-the-resources&quot;&gt;How can I use the resources?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These resources are designed to help you understand what being an ally is and resources to help. This involves guidance around terminology, why we need allies in the workplace and what allies can do to support. You can help by sharing these resources with your colleagues and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I use the resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may like to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send the resources around your team or directorate, including a link to this page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create space to discuss these resources at a team-meeting, away-day or in other relevant meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up a allies training session&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use it as an opportunity to engage with your HR Diversity and Inclusion Team, LGBT+ staff network, or senior LGBT+ Champion on how to create an allies network within your department (if your department doesn’t already have one).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;print out some copies of the resources to leave in the communal areas of your workplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-resources-for-lgbt-allies&quot;&gt;Why do we need resources for LGBT+ allies?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an LGBT+ ally is about being an active supporter of LGBT+ people in the workplace and creating an inclusive environment where people feel able to bring their whole selves to work. Good allies recognise that LGBT+ people can perform better if they can be themselves and allies use their role within an organisation to create a culture where this can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These resources are designed to help non LGBT+ Civil Servants support their LGBT+ colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/07/01/ruby-pride-on">&lt;p&gt;Ruby reflects on Pride this year and shows us a badge they collected at their first ever pride in London, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lMohKiDiKGQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got something to show you. Look at my wee badge! This is for my first ever pride, London 92. I’d just come down to get work and suddenly, there’s this amazing, fabulous free festival going on, where everyone was welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I never really understood categories and labels for people, and this suited me just fine cause it’s all about inclusion. Back then I was involved in action groups, committed to equality and civil rights, and be calling folk out for injustice and bigotry. As I’ve got older I’ve learned to pick my battles but pride is, and always has been a protest and there’s still much needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also a celebration. It gives us visibility, that gives us connection. Going to pride is a big deal. It’s an event you prepare, for you dress up for, it’s gay christmas! I think I had my first ever champagne breakfast before one pride, and it has certainly not been my last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been going to my local pride recently, it’s much smaller so you don’t immediately lose everyone that you came with, but still it gives us visibility, it gives us connection. This year I would have been marching with my MOD colleagues, but I’ll still be celebrating online and locally for socially distanced. But I’ll still be smiling, waving, talking, listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look! (Shows rainbow bunting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only so much you can do, but you can do so much more than you think&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/06/30/what-does-pride-mean-to-you">&lt;p&gt;Colleagues at the Insolvency Service have been discussing what pride means to them, especially during the difficult and uncertain times that we currently find ourselves in. Here are their thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZzxuKV5rkI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does pride mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 1:&lt;/em&gt; Pride for me is an opportunity for all of the LGBT plus community to  come together, to celebrate our inclusion in the community and to also celebrate our differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 2:&lt;/em&gt; It should be that simple. There shouldn’t be questions. People should be able to be who they are, without discrimination without question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 3:&lt;/em&gt;  Well, it’s a celebration. It’s usually a hell of a party. But it’s also a reminder that the job’s not done, there’s an awful lot more still to do before we get anywhere close to genuine equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 4:&lt;/em&gt; There’s a lot of people on this planet. As a parent it’s really important to me to raise my boy to be kind and tolerant. It seems ridiculous and petty to treat people differently because of who they choose to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 5:&lt;/em&gt; It’s a safe space for you to go. Pride is like a big hug; You will find your people and they will be entirely welcoming to you. It’s just a really special thing to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 6:&lt;/em&gt; It is a celebration, a celebration of people, all people. Where people would like to live in a world of respect, consideration, support and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 7:&lt;/em&gt; For me pride is an important time of the year. It’s a celebration of the LGBT plus community, and a reminder of our ongoing struggle for rights and freedoms within the UK and the wider world. Pride for me isn’t just partying and music, it’s more than that. It’s an opportunity to celebrate LGBT plus history, culture, activism and life experience. We march because we can and for those who cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 8:&lt;/em&gt; For me pride is a celebration of equality and diversity. And whilst those celebrations will take on a very different form this year, I still think we have cause to sit back and reflect on how far we’ve come, where we’re heading, and take a moment to celebrate the progress that we’ve all made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 9:&lt;/em&gt; Pride for me is inclusion, acknowledging, and more importantly, accepting someone’s true self. Whether that is gender identity or sexuality. It gives them the confidence and support to live their true lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 10:&lt;/em&gt; For me pride is about being who you are. Accepting who you are, and being proud of who you are. It’s about saying this is me, and I’m proud to be me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 11:&lt;/em&gt; Pride means to me a very visible recognition of the challenges and struggles faced by LGBT plus colleagues. And also a very visible response to those challenges and struggles. Through which we can help create a truly inclusive workplace, where we can all be the best versions of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2020/06/26/celebrating-pride-2020/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBUgJ-MrxpQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that today I would have been looking forward to donning my Civil Service Pride T-shirt and attending the Pride in London Parade tomorrow (27 June), and then Black Pride, the next day. Civil servants have been supporting Pride events across the country for some years, and I am not the only one who is disappointed that we are unable to participate in the same way this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Pride is still being celebrated in the Civil Service. This is thanks to the efforts of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, who organised PrideON, a programme of digital events throughout June. The programme culminates today in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-26-walls-of-pride-pride-on/&quot;&gt;Walls of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, a showcase of displays in response to a call to LGBT+ people and allies to pick a wall in their house and create a scene that represents what Pride means to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hats off to the network for ensuring that the Civil Service can still celebrate this important event in the LGB&amp;amp;TI calendar. This year, the Civil Service Year of Inclusion, Pride has a particular significance, when some of our LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues have been experiencing feelings of isolation, separated from their workplaces and their usual support networks because of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Pride – however you choose to mark it!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2020/06/25/2020-06-25-how-to-be-a-good-ally-rikesh-nagamah/">&lt;h4 id=&quot;rikesh-nagamah-is-a-vice-chair-for-the-civil-service-lgbt-network-you-can-find-out-more-about-them-here&quot;&gt;Rikesh Nagamah is a Vice Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. You can find out more about them &lt;a href=&quot;/about/our-team/leadership/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allyship is a lifetime commitment to educating yourself, listening to constructive criticism, learning from your mistakes, doing your research and staying aware. Allyship shouldn’t be a performative act that lasts for a day or a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an LGBT+ community, we continuously question how non-LGBT people should act as better allies and actively do more to support us. Whilst that’s true, we cannot deny or conceal that even within our own community, discrimination is so evidently and blatantly present. The more we fail at identifying and tackling those prejudice views and behaviours, we inadvertently encourage non-LGBT people to continuously use inappropriate language and behaviours because we’ve shown them that its normal to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Lives Matter has necessarily highlighted the abuse and animosity against Black individuals, not only from white groups but BAME communities, who have become far too comfortable in using negative and insensitive language. Much of this is due to the damaging media representation and misconception of history. Within BAME communities, casual racism and colourism exists at home and in relationships, much of which is because of ‘generational’ differences and never being challenged on controversial views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Black Lives Matter protests have erupted across the globe, the plight of the Black trans community – who face disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination in comparison to other LGBT+ people – have been overlooked. We are eager to say Black Lives Matter but are withheld and absent when trans and queer are added. This is evident with the murder of two Black trans women, Dominique ‘Rem’mie’ Fells and Riah Milton, who are believed to be the 13th and 14th murders of trans or gender non-conforming people in the United States this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important jobs that we can do within our community as allies, is to amplify the voices of the unheard. An ally who makes space, is one who is caring and supporting the community on a constant basis. Avoid being a performative ally who only cares about issues when it’s trendy and takes up a lot of space. Using your voice to amplify the voices of others, will help to keep the momentum of bringing social change and difference to the lives of those who need it the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a majority of us, we’ve grown up within communities or households that weren’t so open and understanding of the LGBT+ community and even growing up in environments that didn’t even allow for conversations about sex, gender identity and expression. If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable during discussions with or about the LGBT+ community, make sure you challenge yourself. There is never a wrong time to challenge the personal discomforts you are feeling. Being an ally means encouraging acceptance wherever you see a lack it. Be confident enough to go against the norm respectfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to being a valuable ally is listening. If and when someone is comfortable to open up about their experience, simply listen to them. If a person shares their personal pronouns with you, be intentional about using them, even when that person isn’t in the room. Be an ally that encourages others to stop and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education is fundamental to becoming a better ally, both for the community and non-LGBT individuals. It’s selfless to keep up-to-date on the issues that currently affect the LGBT+ community. By taking responsibility and keeping informed about issues which affect black and BAME LGBT+ individuals, you then begin to develop an understanding to the experiences and traumas people have faced. Remember, it is unfair to expect LGBT+ people to relive their trauma (e.g. someone’s coming out experience) or validate their existence for your own understanding. There is an extensive amount of research, statistics and historical information available through online resources but make sure they are trustworthy before sharing and educating others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often feel uncertain or uncomfortable to ask questions but re-evaluate yourself to ensure those questions are not offensive or inconvenient. If you find difficulty in understanding certain topics, like the importance of using correct gender pronouns, locate resources that will help you navigate those concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT+ charities in the UK are continuously doing ground-breaking work to support disadvantage groups and strive to make a positive change in the community and in people lives. Whether you choose to donate, volunteer or even share this article to help spread awareness… do whatever you can to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that is going on in the world, we need to remember the importance of being a good ally and the positive impact it has. Even if that means reminding ourselves again and again to what we need to do, then so be it. Our lives are so busy and many us are in fortunate situations, so help to be the best ally you can be to those who need it the most. Let us continue to keep the momentum of bringing about change.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2020/06/25/2020-06-25-oxford-job-centre-pride-month-celebrations/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;mark-is-currently-the-civil-service-lgbt-lead-for-south-east-england-and-a-dwpride-committee-member-and-lead-for-southern-england&quot;&gt;Mark is currently the Civil Service LGBT+ lead for South East England and a DWPride Committee Member and Lead for Southern England.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today at Oxford Job Centre (24 June 2020) we celebrated LGBT  Pride month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt it was important to mark this event as normally LGBT + communities and their allies would be marking the occasion by parading and partying throughout this month. Obviously, this was not going to happen this year, but I thought it was important that the occasion was still recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decorated the ground floor of our job centre with 10 different flags from our some of our various communities (these flags included the standard Rainbow flag, the BAME Rainbow flag, as well as flags representing, Asexual, Bisexual, Pansexual, Trans, Gender Non Binary and Gender Fluid communities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/oxford-jcp-pride-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inviting our colleagues throughout the Oxfordshire Job Centre Cluster along with our Counter Fraud and Compliance Debt Colleagues, myself and my colleague Kate, co-presented 45 minutes of quizzes (a picture round featuring famous LGBT+ people, multiple choice round featuring famous LGBT+ people and events, and a music round with performers coming from LGBT+ communities and their allies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave a talk at the beginning of the session arguing why events such as Pride are still needed as despite having more equality in law as this is not always recognised in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily here at the DWP we have themes such as “I can be me in DWP” and “ bring your true self to work” and also with 2020 being the Civil Service Year of inclusion and high profile Civil Service Initiatives  such “PrideON”, I think we are certainly progressing as an employer here, but we still have a way to go and unfortunately there will always be some pockets of resistance that need to be challenged as we go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2020/06/16/2020/06/16/alan-pride-on-blog</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2020/06/16/2020-06-16-alan-pride-on-blog/">&lt;p&gt;I was 30 years old when I finally accepted who I was and came out as gay. The catalyst was finding the love of my life - my partner for four years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner is from Nigeria, and though I previously had a limited understanding of the challenges faced by the LGBT community in Nigeria, it was through him I learnt more and discovered that despite Nigeria being a wonderful and vibrant country, it has some of the most oppressive anti-LGBT laws in the world; Nigeria is one of only 12 countries where homosexuality can be punishable by death due to adopting Sharia Law in the northern states in 1999/2000. In the southern states, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/gay-nigeria-lgbt-reality-life-violence-west-africa-flee-micheal-ighodaro-us-abuse-homophobia-a7741161.html&quot;&gt;LGBT community are repeatedly targeted&lt;/a&gt; following the introduction of the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generations before me risked all to fight for the rights and freedoms that my partner and I currently enjoy now in the UK. With rights comes responsibilities, and we owe it to our LGBT family in the rest of the world to advance the cause of freedom and be a voice for the voiceless, especially as it was European colonialism that brought homophobic attitudes and laws to its colonies in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to get involved with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bisialimifoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Bisi Alimi Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (BAF) becoming a Board Member in 2018. BAF was created by the inspirational Nigerian celebrity, Bisi Alimi, after he came out live on TV and was forced to seek asylum in the UK due to his life being threatened ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNEvD-FaaeQ&quot;&gt;Bisi’s story&lt;/a&gt; ). BAF seeks to advance the social acceptance of the LGBT community in Nigeria by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building a wealth of knowledge and evidence through research to inform and influence policy on LGBT issues in Nigeria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Training professionals, including journalists and lawyers, to ensure appropriate media reporting and legal representation from an informed position.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conducting social campaigns geared towards challenging and changing the perceptions of LGBT people in Nigeria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging with businesses in Nigeria to create an awareness of the impact of homophobia on individuals and businesses and thereby creating a healthy and inclusive workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the privilege of visiting Nigeria a couple of times, meeting the staff of the foundation, and getting to understanding the issues faced by the LGBT community, culminating in a brilliant event at the British High Commission in Lagos (pictured). Bisi also organised what can be described at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.herald.ng/lgbt-event-lagos-photos/&quot;&gt;Nigeria’s first PRIDE event&lt;/a&gt; last October, despite the risks to everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as we celebrate PRIDE here in the UK, let’s remember that the occasion is not just a chance to reaffirm our identity, but the opportunity to remember those who fought for our rights and to stand in solidarity with those LGBT persons around the world who live in fear. Let’s use PRIDE to send them our love, to tell them they aren’t alone, and to give them hope of a better future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send us your photos of how you are celebrating pride this year, whether you are taking part in our PrideON events or celebrating ‘socially distanced’ with friends – we want to see your photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also love to see your photos from previous years – do you have a photo from your first pride parade, or your favourite pride memory? Send them over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will collate them into a slideshow to launch at the end of the month – so together we can keep #PrideON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ler_Y7WOPKs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Alan Evans. I’m the Director General for Legal Services at HMRC and I’m also really proud to be the Department’s LGBT Champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more than 30 years now since my first pride march in London and we’ve seen huge advances since that time. In the rights, the respect, the visibility of LGBT People, not least in the Civil Service, but the experience of the last couple of months, the experience in particular of the lockdown has been a reminder of the fragility of those hard-won rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s the physical isolation which we’ve all been experiencing which can compound the emotional isolation that many of us have felt at different times in our lives, and then there’s the coming together of the home and work environment in one space, which has not been straight forward for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t be able to march this year, but voices won’t go unheard and it’s why I’m delighted to be supporting the Civil Service LGBT Network’s PrideON campaign. They’ll be events and other activities running throughout June. Please do look out for them, please get involved. It’s important and let’s not forget this is a celebration. Pride is a celebration and so they’ll be a lot of fun events as part of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, please do keep reaching out in your workplaces and in your communities to support others and keep campaigning in big and small ways. That sense of community that has brought us together and brought us so far is now more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Pride.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/06/11/craft-blog">&lt;h2 id=&quot;pride-on-events&quot;&gt;Pride On Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are holding three crafting events, on Tuesday June 16th we will be holding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-16-bake-along-pride-on/&quot;&gt;bake-a-long to create your own rainbow roses&lt;/a&gt;. And then on Friday June 26th, we are organising a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-26-rainbow-basket-pride-on/&quot;&gt;rainbow basket making session&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-26-walls-of-pride-pride-on/&quot;&gt;showcase for walls of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. So come and join us, and celebrate your pride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crafts-in-the-lgbt-community&quot;&gt;Crafts in the LGBT Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at images from past &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39466318/amazing-images-of-the-rainbow-flag-around-the-world&quot;&gt;pride parades&lt;/a&gt;, you can often see a sea of homemade flags, signs and outfits. The sewing machine Gilbert Baker used to make the first flag is now in a museum! Underrepresented groups have also used crafts to recreate and reinvent the images of the LGBT+ movements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/inclusive-pride-flag-confronting-racism-lgbt&quot;&gt;adding stripes to represent people of colour&lt;/a&gt; and including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2018/06/12/daniel-quasar-lgbt-rainbow-flag-inclusive/&quot;&gt;chevron of the trans flag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafts have also played an important part in LGBT+ protests, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britishmuseum.org/wear-pride-lgbtq-badges-british-museum&quot;&gt;British Museum has collected over 400 badges&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds of organisations to record the history of campaigns and protest in the UK. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2011/06/collecting-an-epidemic-the-aids-memorial-quilt.html&quot;&gt;National AIDS memorial quilt in the US&lt;/a&gt; was crafted as a very personal tribute, with panels often featuring bright colours and sequins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-stories-from-volunteers&quot;&gt;Personal stories from volunteers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Particularly as a LGBT+ woman who struggles to be publicly out I’ve found that crafting is a great way for me to connect with other people in the community and show my pride.” - Clare R&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m part of a queer yarn group that meets once a month. I really like being part of a queer community in a way that isn’t about bars and pubs, and it made talking to people when I joined the group much easier, since we have our projects to talk about.” - Emily S&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I discovered basketry nearly two decades after finishing college. In it I recognised a set of constructional techniques that could be used to make really complex objects out of mundane materials (paper, string, recycled stuff) without loads of specialist equipment. I wanted to make the rainbow basket partly to get involved with the Pride celebrations, partly just to prove to myself that I could do it and partly to show fellow members of the LGBT+ community what kinds of things are possible and that while basketry might seem old fashioned, you really can use it to express yourself!” - Gareth W&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m Nikki Holland, Director of Investigations at the National Crime Agency and I also have the great pleasure of being the Champion for Embrace which is our LGBT network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m equally proud of both the roles and all the work that goes on publicly and behind the scenes to make sure we have and inclusive workforce that celebrates diversity and to put the most harmful offenders in prison and protect the most vulnerable in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel privileged to be the Embrace champion and was delighted to be chosen when I came to the agency. I have several LGBT friends and family members and have met some truly inspirational people across my career who demonstrated the importance of LGBT and the Allies and I am proud to be one such voice and one such active Ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attend pride events every year with the NCA to show my personal support for the agency to all our LGBT colleagues and those people in the community. It’s important we continue to publicly show this support and encourage LGBT+ people to come and join the NCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride this year may have been cancelled or postponed but they will be back. In the meantime it is important that we continue to spread our messages and to show our support in other ways and I look forward to see you all at pride events in the future. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Jonathan Mills and I’ve got the great honour of being the champion in DWP and my message in a time like this as a proud ally - is first, let’s keep looking out for each other. Now more than ever it’s really important that we are looking after each other, supporting each other, helping each other with our mental health and our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, don’t let anyone tell you that just because of everything else that’s on we should not be lowering our ambitions, letting our standards slip, we need to keep challenging ourselves to being the most diverse, inclusive civil service that we can be. And then last but not least at all, keep finding ways of coming together as a community of being together and that’s why Pride is so important, a way of remembering all the challenges the communities have faced down the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a great way of renewing the energy we need to face the challenges that we’ve got today. So good luck and look forward to being on the journey with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Menna Rawlings, I’m the diversity and inclusion champion on the foreign office board and I’m also very proud to say I’m an Ally of the LGBTQ+ community - as you can see from my badge which was given to me by my daughter who happens to be queer and that’s just one of the many reasons that I want to support the community as we approach the month of pride and just let you know that I am thinking of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that colleagues across the civil service will not be able to celebrate pride in the same way as usual and I know that’s sad, but hopefully by next year we’ll be back to celebrating it in the normal way with marches and parties. But for now I hope quietly we can still celebrate the month of pride and what it stands for in terms of defending and promoting the rights of LGBTQ+ staff in the Civil Service and across our Diplomatic Network around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s it really, I just wanted you to know that your allies are thinking of you and are with you in these COVID times and Happy Pride Month.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;li&gt;two of the Network’s new vice-chairs, James Jefferson and Marc Fitchett, about the PrideON programme of digital events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lucy Pedrick from DCMS about the accessibility of traditional Pride events, bi inclusion and intersectionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first episode of &lt;em&gt;the PrideON podcast&lt;/em&gt; will launch on Monday 15 June 2020 and new episodes will be released every week.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/06/08/mark-gray-video-message-pride-on">&lt;p&gt;A video message from Mark Gray, the LGBTI Champion at the Crown Prosectuion Service, for Civil Service PrideON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w63j7CTkaew&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’m Mark Gray the LGBTI Champion for the Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took over this role one particular statistic that really struck me was that 60% of LGBT people who are already out to friends and family go back into the closet once they enter the job market. That’s a real shock and I think that suggests though the movement has won huge front ground in terms of the legislative victories that it’s won over a relatively short period of time - the right to marry, the right to adopt, the right to be protected against hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a long way to go in terms of societal attitudes and attitudes in the workplace and I think, you know, the fact that people still feel they need to kind of feel not bring their full selves to work to try and avoid being in a difficult situation, or really perhaps damaging their career prospects is very sad and makes me feel really angry and everyone really should feel comfortable in the workplace whoever they are. And certainly, in the CPS, that is something I really want to make sure that everyone who works for our organisation feels able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to Pride, you know, of course, pride won’t magically make everyone comfortable and similarly it won’t magically make everyone think about the impact of their behaviours and how they act on others. But what it can do is help to challenge perceptions, help to change attitudes and help to drive different thought processes into people across the whole of society. And so, this year therefore, the combination of having to cancel lots of events in the community and of course the general challenges of social distancing can make this a particularly tough time for LGBTI people in general and work colleagues in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are one of those people, please do reach out for support you’re not alone. If you are a colleague, please do think about how your behaviours, your actions might be impacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and however you end up celebrating in these strange and uncertain times make sure you have a safe and Happy Pride 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PrideON is a programme of digital events and content across the month of June to help celebrate Pride in the Civil Service. Do you have a digital event or content that you want us to share? &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These resources are designed to help you understand what being an ally is and resources to help. This involves guidance around terminology, why we need allies in the workplace and what allies can do to support.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can help by sharing these resources with your colleagues and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-i-use-the-resources&quot;&gt;How can I use the resources?&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You may like to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send the resources around your team or directorate, including a link to this page&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;create space to discuss these resources at a team-meeting, away-day or in other relevant meetings&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;set up a allies training session&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;use it as an opportunity to engage with your HR Diversity and Inclusion Team, LGBT+ staff network, or senior LGBT+ Champion on how to create an allies network within your department (if your department doesn’t already have one).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;print out some copies of the resources to leave in the communal areas of your workplace&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A​l​l​i​e​s​ are essential to help create inclusive and supportive workplace environments for LGBT+ employees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, we want everyone to feel included and valued for who they are. We know that LGBT+ Civil Servants may feel less included and more at risk of discrimination than their cisgender and heterosexual peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;However, cisgender and heterosexual/straight Civil Servants can act as allies to support LGBT+ colleagues, raise awareness and encourage equality in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Likewise, being an ally is not limited to being cisgender or straight. LGBT+ colleagues can act as allies to each other, for both those who identify the same as them or differently from them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-allies-in-the-workplace&quot;&gt;Why do we need allies in the workplace?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2019&quot;&gt;​Civil Service statistics: 2019​&lt;/a&gt;’ reported that the Civil Service headcount for 2019 was 445,480. Below are the statistics based on sexual orientation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Reporting rates for sexual orientation have increased from 38.1% in 2015 when it was first collected, to 57.2% in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Of which, 4.9% identify as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or recorded their sexual orientation as ‘other’ (LGBO) in 2019, up from 4.6% in 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This has increased every year since data on sexual orientation has been captured in these statistics, and is up 1.2 percentage points since 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to Stonewall’s ‘LGBT in Britain - Work Report 2018’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;More than a third of LGBT staff (35per cent) have hidden that they are LGBT at work for fear of discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One in eight lesbian, gay and bi people (12 per cent) wouldn’t feel confident reporting any homophobic or biphobic bullying to their employer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One in five trans people (21 per cent) wouldn’t report transphobic bullying in the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Almost a third of non-binary people (31 per cent) and one in five trans people (18 per cent) don’t feel able to wear work attire representing their gender expression.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nearly two in five bi people (38 per cent) aren’t out to anyone at work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-allies-do&quot;&gt;What can allies do?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;avoid-assumptions&quot;&gt;Avoid assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Avoid making assumptions about a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Avoid assuming a person’s pronouns - instead ask a colleague their pronouns and use the correct pronouns when referring to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Avoid assumptions about a person’s relationships - using neutral language such as ‘they’ or ‘partner’ instead of ‘he/she’ or ‘boyfriend/girlfriend’ can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Don’t assume you know someone’s experiences and/or oppressions based on restrictive stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even if you identify as LGBT+, don’t assume you know someone’s experiences and/or oppressions based on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Don’t assume that all LGBT+ people are out. Remember that people are at different points of coming out or transitioning - so respect people’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be aware that a person’s sexuality, gender identity and gender expression may vary and not correspond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;educate-yourself&quot;&gt;Educate yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Read stories online or in books to gain an understanding of LGBT+ history, legislation and people’s lived experiences of discrimination and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can even educate yourself by watching films that detail LGBT+ history, legislation and people’s lived experiences of discrimination and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies should inform themselves and seek sources of information independently rather than assuming minority colleagues are there to inform them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand that different identities come with individual challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Learn the differences between lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans as well as queer, intersex, asexual and pansexual along with gender fluid and non-binary identities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Learn and avoid inappropriate questions and discriminative language.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand and learn the difference between someone’s sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Recognise the importance of using people’s correct pronouns - ‘she/her’, ‘he/him’ and ‘they/them’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand that everyone has different experiences that come with different advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Learn about intersectionality, whereby people face dual discrimination and inequality because of more than one factor, such as: sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender re-assignment, race, class disability, or religion &amp;amp; beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;understand-your-privilege&quot;&gt;Understand your privilege&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand and recognise what privileges you hold as heterosexual and/or cisgender person that an LGBT+ person might not (considering intersectionality).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand and recognise that you can never know how someone elses discrimination and inequality feels, but you can use your voice to raise awareness of LGBT+ issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understand your own unconscious bias.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do not deny people’s experiences or feelings just because they are not things you have experienced or felt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be mindful that not all LGBT+ people have the freedom to be out due to certain circumstances.
Even if you are out and proud, remember that others may not be free to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;listen&quot;&gt;Listen&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consider your own behaviour; ask for feedback, reflect, adapt and learn how to behave in ways that invite people in, instead of pushing them away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Listen with an open mind and don’t restrict people’s experiences to stereotypes to help create an inclusive and safe space for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be okay with not always being part of the conversation, as well as being prepared to be 
there for the good times ​and​ the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Listen​ then respond to LGBT+ people’s requests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Don’t assume you have enough knowledge or understanding to speak for​ the community. Listen, learn and speak to LGBT+ people to find out what changes they want, ​then​ act.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Make space so that the quiet/unnoticed/missing voices can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sign petitions to help demand LGBT+ inclusion and change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Support LGBT+ events (e.g. Pride) by attending, volunteering, raising money or helping advertise (e.g. sharing posts online).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;speak-up&quot;&gt;Speak up&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be a voice for the LGBT+ community when they aren’t in the room, including being prepared to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Challenge constructively when you see something going wrong – an inappropriate comment or an interaction that is failing to build relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Follow the appropriate bullying and harassment procedure if you become aware of homophobia, biphobia or transphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;act-at-work&quot;&gt;Act at work&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can join and support your department’s LGBT+ Network and take-action in solidarity ​alongside​ your LGBT+ colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can be visible and encourage work to be a safe space by attending LGBT+ events, wearing a rainbow lanyard or putting posters up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Make a habit of introducing yourself with your pronouns, not just in LGBT+ specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Use neutral language such as ‘they’ and ‘partner’ to avoid excluding people from the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Add your pronouns to your email sign off or note that you are an ally/member of your LGBT+ Network to help make people feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Highlight key LGBT+ dates in your department’s newsletters and other communications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Run events in your office to mark key LGBT+ dates or raise money for LGBT+ charities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you set up an event, be mindful that people may not want an LGBT+ event in their calendar as they are not out at work. Therefore, set the calendar invite as private to prevent any risk and to help make LGBT+ people feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you email LGBT+ Network members, be mindful that people may not want others to see their email address in a LGBT+ email as they are not out at work. Therefore, blind copy them in to prevent any risk and to help make LGBT+ people feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Share and raise awareness of LGBT+ events in your office and department. You may make someone feel more comfortable at work, or you may encourage someone to attend who otherwise wouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Encourage change if there aren’t LGBT+ policies or training in place to help raise awareness and tackle discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Start a network if there isn’t one already.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Encourage conversations about LGBT+ issues to promote inclusion in the office – there may be someone around you who isn’t out, and this could make them feel supported and comfortable at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is such an important part of the LGBTI+ calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we can’t organise events  in the way we normally would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Pride is just as important as ever, if not even more during these times so we are determined to celebrate LGBTI+ colleagues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the Civil Service LGBT+ Network has organised a whole series of digital events and content for the whole month of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They like me, are determined to celebrate Pride and keep PrideON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whether you are into quizzes, or photography or baking or any of the other sort of events organised by the network log on to www.civilservice.lgbt/pride&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up as quickly as possible because the events are going fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an online exercise class with a special guest, there’s a book club, a podcast, all sorts of stuff that will help us together to celebrate pride and keep PrideON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;PrideON is a programme of digital events and content across the month of June to help celebrate Pride in the Civil Service. Do you have a digital event or content that you want us to share? &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/06/01/why-do-we-need-pride-on">&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-pride&quot;&gt;Why do we need Pride?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June is Pride, the month chosen to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots. As a
result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT
people have had in the world. A momentous time to reflect on and celebrate every
part of the LGBT+ community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is significantly important, as it is a special occasion for us to remember our
queer history, continue to raise awareness of LGBT+ issues and campaign for the
freedoms that will allow all in our community to live their lives on a genuinely equal
footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is a beautiful celebration for all LGBT+ people to proclaim and embrace their
identities, with the ability to freely express their most authentic self without any
judgement. Pride includes people of every race and faith, whether disabled or able-
bodied, and all sexualities and genders as well as straight and cis allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears over a rise in homophobia make Pride important. For that one month in a year,
we take over with our friends and allies, and say loudly and proudly that we exist and
that we are entitled to and deserve respect, dignity, and equal rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the untimely arrival of Covid-19, the Civil Service LGBT+ network have worked
hard to move Pride online, to accommodate the lockdown rules and support social
distancing. Our network continues to provide a platform for every part of the LGBT+
community. Thereby, we are delighted to host…PrideON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exciting series of digital events and content, which recreate all the fabulous things
that Pride offers. Project managed and supported by a team of committed
volunteers, who have enlisted their free time, they have aspired to ensure that all
LGBT+ Civil Servants and allies can safely celebrate our community and continue to
voice for our place in society. Our group of volunteers are passionate about equality
and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prides are empowering. They are events about human rights and empowering
LGBT+ individuals to reclaim the rights and freedoms they are denied, and the public
space they are often excluded from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride will forever remain a historical landmark event to give our LGBT+ people a
platform to be visible and speak loudly to the rest of the country about what we have
achieved, how far we have come and what is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-let-the-colours-of-the-rainbow-rain-on-you-we-are-keeping-prideon&quot;&gt;So, let the colours of the rainbow, Rain. On. You! We are keeping #PrideON.&lt;/h3&gt;</content>

But here in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network we have been determined to keep PrideON in 2020.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;with-the-help-of-our-amazing-members-we-have-planned-a-programme-of-digital-events-and-content-across-the-month-of-june-for-you-all-to-enjoy-and-get-involved-with&quot;&gt;With the help of our amazing members, we have planned a programme of digital events and content across the month of June for you all to enjoy and get involved with.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have many exciting events planned such as a Big PrideON quiz, bingo, crafting activities, bake along, panel discussions and so much more. You can see the full calendar of events open to all LGBT+ Civil Servants and Allies at www.civilservice.lgbt/pride. Be sure to check them out and sign up as some spaces are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From w/c 15th June, we will be publishing digital content across all our channels. You will want to check out the PrideON playlist, the PrideON podcast and a set of blog posts on things that matter during the pride month. Also, keep an eye out for a famous face who has exclusively created some content for us all to enjoy. All content will also be published on our website www.civilservice.lgbt/pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are following our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep updated with everything we are doing throughout the month and help celebrate our LGBT+ community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been busy planning to keep PrideON over the past few months and we are so excited to finally share it with you, but we still need your help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spread-the-word&quot;&gt;Spread the word:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more Civil Servants that know about PrideON, the more we are able to celebrate pride digitally and ensure that even with the coronavirus restrictions, Pride in 2020 is not forgotten about, that our voices are heard, and we continue to be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actions-you-can-take-now&quot;&gt;Actions you can take now:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have created a whole package of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/prideON-digital-assets-2020&quot;&gt;digital assets&lt;/a&gt; for you to use and share around your teams to promote LGBT+ visibility. Be sure to post these on social media, add one to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/assets/documents/PrideON%20email%20signature%20upload.docx&quot;&gt;email signature&lt;/a&gt;, change your video call background and encourage your colleagues to do the same.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use our communications tool kit to spread the word.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ask your department to post a blog on your intranet to explain how we are keeping PrideON. We have created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/assets/documents/Template%20departmental%20intranet%20post%20for%20PrideON%20upload.docx&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; for you to use.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Email your network chair, directors, leadership team to make them aware of what’s happening. We have a created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/assets/documents/Template%20email%20for%20PrideON%20upload.docx&quot;&gt;draft email&lt;/a&gt; for you to use.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A huge part of Pride is telling stories of the LGBT+ community and being visible. We want to know:&lt;/li&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/05/20/mhaw-emily">&lt;h2 id=&quot;emily-is-a-senior-policy-advisor-on-future-prisons-policy-at-the-ministry-of-justice&quot;&gt;Emily is a Senior Policy Advisor on Future Prisons Policy at the Ministry of Justice.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-did-you-choose-to-become-a-mental-health-first-aider&quot;&gt;Why did you choose to become a mental health first aider?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d been having more and more conversations with friends and loved ones about mental health. The first few of those conversations felt quite daunting and scary, but the more you talk about mental health the more confident and reassuring you can be. It felt quite a natural decision to go and become a MHFA as you never know when you might need those skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-a-mental-health-first-aider-do-what-kind-of-support-can-they-offer-colleagues&quot;&gt;What does a mental health first aider do? What kind of support can they offer colleagues?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea that just like physical illnesses you might also need first aid for your mental health. Its funny really that first aid for mental health is a new concept and was only introduced in 2017 when it makes so much sense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health first aid is akin to its physical counterpart as the first aider is not a qualified professional and they are not trained to diagnose, but rather to provide immediate assistance (think of grabbing that nearby first aid kit). We’ve been trained to spot signs of deteriorating mental health and so may intervene if we notice someone at work is particularly struggling. The conversation with your MHFA is confidential (except in instances where there might be immediate harm or if there is gross misconduct) and mainly we listen to what you have to say and offer reassurance. We’ll then guide you through the ways you can get professional support. The civil service is great and has loads of means of accessing mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-your-personal-relationship-to-mental-health-why-is-this-a-significant-topic-for-you&quot;&gt;What is your personal relationship to mental health? Why is this a significant topic for you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that my mental health was something I could ignore as it seemed to be just fine. However, as I’ve got a bit older, I find the best way to stay on top of my own mental health is to actively notice when I might be going through a dip. I like to think of mental health as a continuum and some weeks or months you might need to apply a bit more effort to get yourself feeling better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;has-your-lgbt-identity-influenced-your-experiences-or-relationship-with-mental-health-in-any-way&quot;&gt;Has your LGBT+ identity influenced your experiences or relationship with mental health in any way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I realized about my LGBT+ identity in my early twenties and as LGBT+ identities are not the norm (although thankfully they are becoming more so) it definitely freaked me out to begin with. I’ve seen lots of my LGBT+ friends really struggling with their identities and that contributed to me wanting to become a MHFA so I could know how to support them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-you-do-to-work-through-mentally-challenging-times-what-kind-of-advice-can-you-give-others-during-lockdown-but-also-more-generally&quot;&gt;What do you do to work through mentally challenging times? What kind of advice can you give others during lockdown, but also more generally?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m someone that likes to have lots of plans in the future and this period in lockdown has really made me re-evaluate that. Instead I’ve tried to focus on planning fun things to do like cooking, games, and excursions for the week ahead. I’m trying hard not to think about what will be happening this time next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, if I notice my mental health taking a turn for the worse, I try to mention it to my girlfriend, my housemate, or my mum – I think there is something about calling yourself out that helps me to get a bit of perspective on how I’m feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-something-you-wish-more-people-knew-about-mental-health&quot;&gt;What is something you wish more people knew about mental health?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I took away from my MHFA course is that as a society we are much better at talking about common mental health problems. What we are not so great at is talking about rarer forms of mental health conditions and how to support people with those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mental Health First Aiders are trained and accredited by MHFA England. You can find out more about their work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFRCdgXGlig&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Training is delivered at departmental level in the Civil Service. If you’re interested in reaching out to, or training to be, a Mental Health First Aider, please contact your local HR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<updated>2020-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/05/20/mhaw-kay</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/05/20/mhaw-kay">&lt;h2 id=&quot;kay-works-in-debt-management-in-dwp-and-is-a-mental-health-first-aider&quot;&gt;Kay works in Debt Management in DWP, and is a Mental Health First Aider.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I become a Mental Health Firs Aider (MHFA)? Because I know how lonely it can be at times to not have someone to talk to and how this can lead to added stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in a small village in East Lancashire, within sight of Pendle Hill – a  fairly reactionary place in relation to religion and differences in general. I have always been shy and had trouble making friends - I was bullied for a lot of my school years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of this bullying (shyness, unwilling to rock the boat, depression, anxiety about being accepted) led me to a disastrous domestic violence relationship that had long term physical and mental health effects that are still in play today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I did not know that I was bi/pansexual - it was not something I explored until I met my now husband, who supported me in my choices and wishes to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are polyamorous (meaning we form deep attachments to more than one person) and we have a 3rd partner, who is female - I consider her my wife the same as my husband is my husband, although this is not recognised in this country as yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bi/pan is not something that looms large in my life - being polyamorous, and Pagan, has more day to day impact, but it is one more aspect of myself where I can often feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m honest, I have always felt lonely, like an outsider, no matter my age or company I am in… that being lonely in a crowd thing? Yes, intimately familiar with this, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is because due to my beliefs, my shyness, my illnesses and my choices – that are not the general norm- I have always felt like I didn’t belong… like could not talk about things as no one would really understand without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately even amongst the LBGTQ+ community it can be lonely as some people perceive being bi/pan as ‘greedy’ or not knowing what you actually are… add in being polyamorous, Pagan and having links to the kink community and it gets even more complicated! (I am a Pagan but did not ‘come out’ until I was in my late twenties due to fear of prejudice-that turned out to be valid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally ‘came out’, as polyamorous, bi/pansexual, and with links to the kink sub culture,  to work, family and friends a couple of years ago because someone was attempting to blackmail me over it. I wish I could say that everyone accepted my choices and me but this was not the case. However, it did help me as I squashed the blackmail attempt and means that I do not need to fear such a thing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first diagnosed with depression in 2005, just after a period of living under stress. At the same time, I was diagnosed with Hemiplegic migraine (I have had chronic migraine since I was 10). I was later diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Osteoarthritis in 2016 after a long period of illness and with anxiety in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over my lifetime I have been a nurse, manager, telephony agent and am now a Complaints Admin Officer. Outside of work I am a qualified counsellor and mentor, as well as an independent interfaith minister. All of these roles have meant that I have had to try to conquer my shyness and to try to maintain a ‘happy outlook’ – there often seems to be a unwritten rule that being ‘miserable’ or depressed is not allowed if you are nurse/manager/minister/etc.! (I  also work as a volunteer mentoring ex-service personnel, and mentor fellow Pagans and LBGT+ people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s being a Pagan who works with a very little known Goddess and getting hassle from Pagans and non-Pagans alike because of that; being polyamorous in a monogamous world; being bi/pan in a world of gay/lesbian/trans (in some cases there seem to be more acceptable); being part of/having links to the kink world… I have always felt like I was on the outside looking in. My choices have not been/are not society’s norms - they are often not even the norms of the sub cultures I am involved in either – prejudice doesn’t just come from outside LBGTQ+/Pagan/Poly/Kink circles - it often comes from within which can make life even lonelier as it feels like there is no one you can talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the stress I feel is linked to the fact that my husband has a genetic condition which means his health is extremely precarious and he could die at any time - there is no cure and the prospect of a long and happy life together is not an option for us. He also has Savant Autism, which can add some stresses all by itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plus side of this is that I try to live each day in itself… i.e. not think too deeply about things and the future… The negative side of this is that when I am ill (or should I say in a more ill state than normal) everything can become overwhelming and it takes me a while to get back to the ‘just think of today’ attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for the DWP has been great in many ways as almost all my managers have been supportive of both my physical and mental health needs. When my depression and anxiety have a flare up I find little things difficult - printing, using shortcuts on word, using a  satnav… Things that may not seem to be connected, but my brain just doesn’t seem to want to let me understand such things at the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish; mental health is now finally being recognised for its importance. It has been a long time coming. Kindness appears to be the theme at the moment - an underrated thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to be a MHFA for all and anyone is free to contact me to chat (although as working from home only have email at present)… If I don’t feel I’m the right person for you to speak to I will discuss this with you and signpost you elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

			<updated>2020-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/05/18/mhaw-tim">&lt;h2 id=&quot;tim-is-a-case-lead-at-the-education-and-skills-funding-agency-and-a-mental-health-first-aider&quot;&gt;Tim is a Case Lead at the Education and Skills Funding Agency, and a Mental Health First Aider.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wonder why I became a Mental Health First Aider. When I was in my early 20s I never really focussed on my career; I worked in the gay village in Manchester as a waiter and enjoyed my social life. On approaching my late 20s I thought I should grow up a bit and get a ‘proper job’ so I found a job at a retail bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I progressed in my career at the bank much quicker than I had ever imagined. I quickly moved up pay grades into a role on a new project. I used to spend a lot of time with my friends and family, enjoyed keeping myself fit and working on my house that I had bought with my boyfriend. I was very proud to have got the role but I stopped spending time on the things I enjoyed and put all my focus into my work. I started working from 7 till 7 in the week and continued working at the weekends. This certainly took its toll on me and started to impact on my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never really thought about my mental health before. I thought I was invincible. I was beaten up by a group of men for being gay, I went to a school where it was a massive deal to be gay and I was brought up being the minister’s son of a Pentecostal church which made it challenging to come out to my parents. Despite all this, I had always been able to keep myself in the main part ‘happy’. I always had a release to the stresses I had to deal with in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project that I worked on at the bank did not go well. I really wanted the project to be a success and I put the success of the project on my own shoulders.  I took responsibility for things at work that I was not responsible for, to try and ensure success. I became very anxious about the work I was doing and I could not let it out of my mind. I would come home from work still thinking about the work. I would eat my tea and not realise what I was eating because I was thinking about work. I would try and go to sleep and not sleep because I was thinking about work. I felt like I didn’t sleep for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend told me that I needed to stop working so much, and that it was making me ill but I didn’t listen. One weekend I was working, I thought what I had written was not worth the paper it was written on so I threw my work notes across the room. After working relentlessly for months, without sleep, I was no longer able to function properly or think clearly. My mind had become so blurred and I became really confused. My boyfriend came into the room and said, ‘You are not going to work tomorrow’, so I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the doctors and I got a sick note. At this point, I really felt that I had failed, I felt worthless, and that I was no good to anyone. My anxiety had also hit the roof. I thought my manager would come round to my house and force me back into work. I tried to use my bank card and it was declined, I thought this was because the bank had blocked my card but it was because I was so anxious, I put the pin in wrong. I didn’t know what I was doing half the time, pacing around rooms and not remembering to eat. I couldn’t focus on anything or enjoy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search   will show you that mental health illness impacts significantly more people in the LGBT+ community than the general population. People have said to me before they don’t understand why. To me it is simple, I was brought up to become something that I am not. I have been told so many times that who I am is wrong or I am someone who should be ashamed of myself. It is not all bad though, it is also the reason why I am who I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got better from my mental health problem quickly. At the time, I thought there was no hope, I would never feel like me again, and wouldn’t be able to enjoy the things that I used to. I had to re-build myself after hitting rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did I get better? I talked a lot. I reached out to people to talk about my feelings and allowed them to help me. Talking really helped and help my mind come back to reality. I also learnt about mindfulness, yoga and meditation. This helped me to sleep again and taught me how to turn my mind off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never take my mental health for granted again. I have a few rules to keep my mind back in the right mindset. I try to stay present. People talk about mindfulness and ‘being present’ a lot these days. So, what does it mean to me? When I was ill, I was not present at all, I was stuck in my head. Being present is about focussing on what you are doing in that moment. Whether that is listening to the birds when you are outside, enjoying the beats and lyrics of music, or concentrating on the taste and textures of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being present to me is also about, not dwelling on the past, not worrying about the future, not worrying about things outside my control and not worrying about expectations. These are expectations I put on myself, expectations I put on others, and expectations that others put on me. This helps me to appreciate the things others do for me, have an open mind, and ignore expectations others put on me, allowing me to be myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became ill because I did not allow myself time to do the things I enjoy or keep myself healthy. Now, I make sure that I give myself time and focus on the beauty in life. Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became a mental health first aider because I want to help others who may also be struggling with their mental health. I am here to listen without judgement, offer hope and direct people to the relevant resources.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title type="html">International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia: Jonathan Slater</title>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/05/15/idahobit-2020">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/15/international-day-against-homophobia-biphobia-and-transphobia/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, 17 May is International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 is the Civil Service Year of Inclusion. Inclusion can be defined as having a sense of belonging, being your authentic self, and having a voice in your organisation. Usually, when we talk about homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, we are thinking about the impact in the workplace – but this year, in the context of COVID-19, it is particularly important for us to think about the impact on LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues at home and in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Civil Service LGB&amp;amp;TI Champion, I am always proud to hear LGB&amp;amp;TI civil servants saying that they feel safe to be their authentic selves at work. But at this time of lockdown and social distancing, it is sad to reflect that some LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues do not feel safe to be their authentic selves at home, or in their communities. For some, they are not ‘out’ at home and are now, therefore, living in a situation where they cannot be themselves, and are constantly fearful of giving themselves away. Others who are ‘out’ to members of their household may be living in an atmosphere of constant hostility. In either case, individuals are currently unable to escape to the safety of their workplace, and are also cut off from their own support networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not people feel safe at home, sadly some LGB&amp;amp;TI people still experience hostility in their communities, and currently there is no escape; in fact some may feel more exposed and vulnerable if they go outside in their neighbourhood to exercise or to go shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let us not forget that domestic abuse also occurs in same sex relationships and relationships involving trans people. Homophobia, biphobia and transphobia have an impact here as well: controlling and abusive partners sometimes use the threat of ‘outing ’ people to their families or communities as a means of control; LGBT victims of domestic abuse often do not have the support of their families and can become very isolated; and LGBT victims are often reluctant to report domestic abuse to the police or other authorities for fear of encountering homophobia/biphobia/transphobia themselves, or exposing their partner to homophobia/biphobia/transphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time our employee networks, at departmental and cross-government level, have a vital role to play in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/&quot;&gt;offering peer support to LGB&amp;amp;TI people&lt;/a&gt; who may be feeling isolated and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s be proud of the progress we have made in the Civil Service to tackle homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and create safe and inclusive working environments for our LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues. And let’s resolve to continue our efforts in our workplaces. But let’s also remember, and be sensitive to, the impact on our LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues of homophobia, biphobia and transphobia that they may be experiencing outside of the workplace, and find ways to let them know that they have our support. And let’s express our gratitude to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/networks/&quot;&gt;LGB&amp;amp;TI networks&lt;/a&gt; for their work offering what can be a lifeline to people in what may seem impossible situations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An asexual person is a person who does not experience sexual attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what is it like to be asexual in the workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, we want everyone to feel included and valued for who they are. However, we know asexual civil servants feel less included than their gay and heterosexual peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Asexual civil servants&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;As a result, we are&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Want a greater sense of community, having felt excluded from both ‘straight’ and ‘LGBT+’ spaces.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Running dedicated, social and supportive events and an online community space for bi, pan, asexual and queer civil servants.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Feel invisible as a result of a lack of recognition and role models in the workplace and wider society.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Raising the profile of asexual civil servants, and encouraging senior role models, departmental LGBT+ networks, and HR teams to monitor, recognise and support minority sexual identities.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Face negative stereotypes, assumptions, a lack of understanding about their identities, and intrusive questions.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Providing knowledge, information and support to individuals, networks and departments.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Are more likely to experience bullying, discrimination and harassment.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Investigating how training and guidance can be developed or improved within the wider Civil Service and also within LGBT+ spaces.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Can face multiple barriers to full participation in the workplace, due to other aspects of their lives and identities in interaction with their sexual orientation.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Working with other Civil Service diversity networks and organising joint initiatives.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asexual (ace)&lt;/strong&gt; means little or no sexual attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey-asexual (greysexual)&lt;/strong&gt; means rare sexual attraction, usually only for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demisexual (demi)&lt;/strong&gt; means sexual attraction after forming a strong emotional bond.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Each sexual orientation has a corresponding romantic orientation. For many people, these two align (asexual/aromantic). However, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-allies-do&quot;&gt;What can Allies do?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies avoid making assumptions about a person’s sexual orientation or gender. Allies make space so that the quiet/unnoticed/missing voices can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies consider their own behaviour; ask for feedback, reflect, adapt and learn how to behave in ways that invite people in, instead of pushing them away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies challenge constructively when they see something going wrong – an inappropriate comment or an interaction that is failing to build relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies follow the appropriate bullying and harassment procedure if they become aware of aphobic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies take into account that every asexual experience is different and does not solely define a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies inform themselves and seek sources of information independently rather than assuming minority colleagues are there to inform them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As a heteroromantic asexual person, I am in a similar position in some ways to bisexuals in an opposite sex relationship in that most people would just assume we were straight.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The only real issue I have come across is getting asexuality recognised as a valid orientation in the same way as other sexual orientations. Some staff surveys offer ‘asexual’ as an option in the sexual orientation box but many do not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The biggest difficulty as an asexual in the Civil Service is that no-one understands what it means and despite the requirements to take E-learning courses in equality and diversity, asexuality isn’t listed once.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Being misunderstood is the greatest problem I face at work. In my personal life this has led to instances of unwanted sexual contact and condescending attitudes from medical professionals I visited when I developed anxiety and panic attacks as a result of unwanted sexual contact.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Occasionally my co-workers are genuinely curious about asexuality, but this leads them to ask increasingly personal questions about my private life that makes me feel uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The difficulty in being myself at work is that I’m backed into disclosing my sexuality to people who don’t accept that it’s real.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“As a heteroromantic asexual, I sometimes feel pressured to identify as “heterosexual” even though I am not, as I don’t think that asexuality is considered a “valid” or “true” orientation by many people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Identifying as asexual in work has always been uncomfortable. My sexuality seems to be a mystery to most of my colleagues, which drives them to ask me whether I find men or women attractive. It’s impossible to avoid the question, and when I answer that I am asexual most people seem to doubt that I’m telling the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/04/27/introducing-new-ace-fact-sheet/">&lt;p&gt;Today, the Bi+ Inclusion Team is proud to launch our asexuality factsheet &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/ace-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;asexuality fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-use-the-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;How can I use the fact sheet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factsheet is designed to raise awareness of asexuality and the experiences of asexual people. You can help by distributing it with your colleagues and networks.
You may like to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send it to your team or directorate, including a link to this blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create space to discuss the factsheet at a team-meeting, away-day or in other relevant meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use it as an opportunity to engage with your HR Diversity and Inclusion Team, LGBT+ staff network, or senior LGBT+ Champion on how to create an inclusive work environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;print out some copies of the factsheet to leave in the communal areas of your workplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-a-factsheet&quot;&gt;Why do we need a factsheet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents to our 2017 consultation who identify as asexual said that they often find themselves in a position where they are perceived as a source of knowledge on LGBT+ issues amongst their colleagues. Whilst an environment of open questions and peer-to-peer learning is a positive one, this put considerable strain on those individuals who may not have the information themselves, may not feel comfortable answering personal questions, and who are also trying to do their day job. They said this sense of strain was sometimes exacerbated by a well-intentioned desire to role model and do things for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support civil servants in these situations, we committed to developing a series of factsheets covering minority sexual orientations and identities. These are intended to be shared by networks and HR functions in order to raise awareness of the full range of LGBT+ identities in the general workforce. They can also be used as a source of information which LGBT+ people can share with their colleagues in order to avoid answering all the questions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bi-inclusion-volunteer-team&quot;&gt;The bi-inclusion volunteer team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After consulting colleagues across government to better understand the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, asexual and queer civil servants, we published &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;our strategic approach to improving the experiences of this group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve created a bi+ inclusion volunteer team to take forward this work, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/30/join-us-at-bispace&quot;&gt;launched BiSpace&lt;/a&gt;, run monthly bi socials and bi-inclusive LGBT socials across the country, and established a regular bi+ inclusion newsletter. Sign up to get the newsletter by ticking ‘Bisexual people’ on the &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us/&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network membership page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone. I am Phoebe and I am working on a climate investment programme in BEIS. I identify as a lesbian and have been out for many years. I am passionate about tackling environmental issues, earth system regeneration and live as green as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in complete solidarity with those that are suffering greatly from this pandemic, I have found solace in the current lockdown as it has presented an opportunity for me to focus more on self-care and not being distracted by endless social commitments. In the past few weeks, I have picked up the piano, learnt how to take apart and wash my bike, baked for the first time, watched quite a few queer films, entered into a meditation challenge and connected a lot more with friends and family across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And living up to the lesbian stereotype, I have a cat named Puccini. He is definitely benefiting from this lockdown as he is able to get a lot more treats out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Lesbian Visibility Week!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/04/20/lesbian-vis-week-tay">&lt;h2 id=&quot;tay-is-a-policy-advisor-at-the-department-for-education-they-talk-about-the-great-culture-of-acceptance-and-inclusivity-across-the-civil-service&quot;&gt;Tay is a Policy Advisor at the Department for Education. They talk about the great culture of acceptance and inclusivity across the Civil Service.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Tay. I work in the Department of Education in education policy, more specifically in teacher wellbeing and workload. I previously worked in HMRC. My experience of working in the Civil Service, in both departments, has been really positive. It has been the first place where I have been able to be myself at work and take my whole self to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service was encouraging from the outset. I was able turn up to an interview presenting as a Butch lesbian and I have continued to come to work as a visibly Butch lesbian, still not facing any push back at. I have not felt uncomfortable or been made to feel uncomfortable by others. I appreciate having that space and being able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I would say if you are not visible, is that there is a great network of support for you. Obviously you don’t have to be.. you know.. ‘all guns blazing with a rainbow flag at the ready’.. if you’re not comfortable, but just know that there is a great culture of acceptance and inclusivity across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from one government department to another government, I have seen no change in that respect at all. At no point have I suddenly had to push myself back in the closet because I was in a new environment. That has never been the case at all, which was really encouraging and really lovely.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/04/21/lesbian-vis-week-caroline">&lt;h2 id=&quot;caroline-is-a-policy-advisor-in-the-civil-service-diversity--inclusion-team-she-shares-her-personal-story&quot;&gt;Caroline is a Policy Advisor in the Civil Service Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion team. She shares her personal story.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a lesbian. A simple statement, but central to who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out in 1976, at the age of 20, after a long internal struggle to try to understand who I was. Coming out started me on a lifelong journey in pursuit of equality, diversity and inclusion. I was a student at the time, but frankly lost interest in studying, preferring to put my energies into being a gay activist. I did manage to graduate, and then went to live in Aberdeen, working first as a gardener and then as a van driver to support my activism (and a fair amount of socialising too!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been outraged by the fact that lesbians at this time commonly lost custody of their children – we were seen as not fit to parent. I remember reflecting on the need for sympathetic solicitors, and decided that perhaps I should try and do something about it. I moved to Newcastle to study law. Three years after qualifying as a solicitor I was involved in setting up a firm which became “go to” solicitors locally for lesbians and gay men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nearly 17 years, I had had enough of the legal profession, and left to become an advocate for a disabled people’s organisation. I then joined the Civil Service in 2008 – not because I wanted to be a civil servant, to be honest, but to take up the role of Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Community Engagement Manager at CPS North East. After nearly 10 years in that role, developing strong relationships with community groups working on all strands of hate crime and in violence against women sector, I took up my current position as LGB&amp;amp;TI Policy Advisor in Civil Service D&amp;amp;I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if I were not a lesbian. Being angry about the invisibility of lesbians, and the discrimination faced by lesbians – both as lesbians and as women - drove all my career choices. Understanding how discrimination works against lesbians meant understanding sexism and helped me to identify connections with and to develop some understanding of other forms of discrimination – if I want lesbians to achieve equality and inclusion, I want that for all lesbians, so I need to be willing to tackle issues of race, disability, socio economic background etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am a civil servant, working in Civil Service D&amp;amp;I in this Year of Inclusion. Inclusion means a sense of belonging, being able to bring your authentic self to work, and having a voice in your organisation. There is always more work to do, but there is much to be proud of in the Civil Service commitment to diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have experienced harassment and abuse, have twice been punched in the face, chosen not to be out in some workplaces, and been aware of gossip and hostility in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can honestly say that in the Civil Service I have had no problem making that simple and authentic statement: I am a lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/04/20/lesbian-vis-week-rachael">&lt;h2 id=&quot;rachael-is-a-policy-advisor-at-the-department-for-transport-and-shes-just-got-engaged&quot;&gt;Rachael is a Policy Advisor at the Department for Transport and she’s just got engaged.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it say about me, who has been a card-carrying member of the lesbian club for the last nine years, that I didn’t even realise there was a lesbian visibility week? I’ve been quite fortunate to be blessed with the confidence to never shut up about being a lesbian, it’s one of the first things I say when I’m introduced to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi, I’m Rachael, I work for the Department for Transport and I’m a huge lesbian, let me tell you about my future wife, do you want to see a picture of her? How about that latest episode of Killing Eve eh? Oh, wait let me get you a rainbow lanyard!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the absolute stunner that will eventually become Mrs Gray (unpopular opinion, I can’t abide double barrelling) it has been a tough year for the two of us. After eight years together, I had to move to London to pursue my career in the civil service – three years of applying for the fast stream and they finally decided to let me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was, and remains, incredibly exciting for me personally and our future as a family (perhaps we may one day break the millennial curse and afford our own home) however it hasn’t been without its challenges. I come home on alternate weekends and promptly break down and embrace the light of my life…my cat Onyx. She misses me very much and the feeling is mutual. Ellie misses me also, but now has the opportunity to keep the house as tidy as she likes – I have a habit of tidying things away and immediately forget where I’ve moved them. It’s very annoying. We’ve both been getting used to living alone and it’s hard when you haven’t been apart from someone for almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never, at any point, doubted that we would spend the rest of our lives together. I knew back in 2011 when we met in a gay bar as members of rival women’s rugby teams, oh and just to throw more clichés in, her ex was also one of my teammates and I wrongly believed I was straight until we met (the Netflix adaptation due out whenever they return my calls…) It’s very easy to fall in love, it’s much harder to stay there. I won’t lie, long distance has been difficult, but it has also made us more appreciative of the time we do get together. It also helped me to put some things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a stereotype about lesbians that they move in together on the second date and tend to jump headfirst into relationships and marriage. By comparison we have been moving at an almost glacial pace and had been dating for eight and a half years by the time I finally decided to propose. Not for lack of forethought but more pragmatic concerns, both us working in minimum wage retail did not leave a lot of money set aside for frivolous expenses when the bills were due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night at work drinks and karaoke (it must be said that my rendition of I Will Survive leaves much to be desired) I decided to announce that I would propose to Ellie. I hadn’t seriously considered it but I was very drunk and very much missed my partner, and I kind of knew she would (probably) say yes. So, I began to plan a proper proposal. After my Uber dropped me off home with cheesy chips of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially thought New Year’s Eve would be a good shout, getting down on one knee as the fireworks went off at midnight. Very romantic. As It happened, we were snuggled up watching a terrible romantic comedy on Christmas Eve and the timing just felt right (even though I’ve always laughed at the people who get engaged over Christmas, like oh I got you the gift of me, no refunds sorry.) I told her to close her eyes and I would give her an early Christmas present – I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She had been expecting a set of pyjamas I’d purchased for her, but was almost as happy with the proposal (they are very nice pyjamas) and she said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are planning to get married on our ten-year anniversary, which is June of next year (so hopefully we will be out of self-isolation by then!) and I couldn’t be more pleased. I am by definition, a clueless lesbian, like I genuinely have no idea that someone is flirting with me – I just assume everybody is as friendly as I am. Having managed to snag a beautiful, funny and intelligent woman who wants to marry me! Astounding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2020/04/15/digital-social-blog">&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday we held our first ever digital social. Thank you to all our fantastic members who joined. We had lots of fun and we hope you did too! We also joined together at 20:00 to #ClapForOurCarers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital social had high interest with over 100 members signing up and 70 joining the Zoom call. We used breakout rooms to facilitate virtual teams, which not only enabled members to participate in the quiz, but to enjoy social time with fellow team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the reflections below from the event organisers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-jefferson-vice-chair&quot;&gt;James Jefferson, Vice Chair:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really loved about the event was the breakdown of our usual spatial barriers. It was great to see so many different departments and areas covered. I also really enjoyed everyone’s enthusiasm during the social, especially towards the ‘break out’ rooms. I know many members made new friends and built new connections - hopefully everyone managed to exchange contact details to keep in touch during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Civil Service LGBT+ network, I want us to be able to facilitate more of these digital socials in the future, so if you have any ideas for the next one, please do let me know. If anyone wants to help with organising, then also please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;astrid-crowley-bi-lead-and-vice-chair&quot;&gt;Astrid Crowley, Bi+ Lead and Vice Chair:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out a digital quiz for the first time was really exciting, and I’m constantly amazed how much we can do online now. Not only were we able to bring colleagues together, but we were able to do so between people from different regions and departments, who may never have had the chance to meet by traditional means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a time for a sense of community more than ever, and I’m looking forward to the precedent this sets for keeping the Civil Service LGBT+ Network engaged and supporting each other, even after these stormier times pass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jordan-ledger-events-coordinator&quot;&gt;Jordan Ledger, Events Coordinator:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had so much fun (with just little bit of stress) organising this quiz with Astrid and James! I was certainly nervous about inescapable technical issues, but thanks to A&amp;amp;J’s great planning it ran pretty smoothly, especially for our first attempt at something like this. I hope you all had a great evening and your hangovers weren’t too bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that feeling anxious, or depressed, or lonely are things we in the LGBT+ community have to face more than other people at the best of times. At the moment, many of us may feel cut off from our usual support networks, and I know a quiz won’t solve everything, but I hope it helped and I hope you all made new friends too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to doing more virtual socials in the coming weeks. If you have any ideas that you think people might enjoy - please do reach out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday we held our first ever digital social. Thank you to all our fantastic members who joined. We had lots of fun and we hope you did too! We also joined together at 20:00 to #ClapForOurCarers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more, you can read the blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/04/15/digital-social-blog&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesbian-visibility-week&quot;&gt;Lesbian Visibility Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week is Lesbian Visibility Week (20th- 26th April). We would love to profile a few of our members who identify as lesbian. To get involved, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your department is hosting any digital events to mark the week, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto@info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; and we will share it on our website and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Lesbian Visibility week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run by the DIVA Media Group, Europe’s biggest LGBTQI media group, Lesbian Visibility Week is to show our solidarity with every woman within the LGBTQI community, as well as celebrate lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that Lesbian Visibility Week is a voice for unity and lifts up ALL women, especially those who come from marginalised communities. Recent research (Pride Matters survey, conducted by Pride In London 2018) has shown that gay women are almost twice as unlikely to be out in the workplace as gay male colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-all-network-chairs&quot;&gt;Calling all Network chairs!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your department doing to support members of the LGBT+ community at this present time, and – looking further ahead, what are your thoughts on the Stonewall WEI for this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some interest from network chairs on the above issues and will be looking to facilitate a discussion in the near future. Please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with your thoughts and if this if something you would be interested in joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of each fortnight you will be sent the name and contact details for another member of the coffee club that you’ve been randomly paired with. You can then arrange a timeslot for you to catch-up with this person for whenever you like within those 2 weeks, you can even arrange several catch-ups if you wish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign up to the coffee club, simply send an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;email to us&lt;/a&gt; showing your interest to us before 14th April. You can still sign up if you express your interest after this date, however you’ll have to wait until the 2nd round of pairings to get matched up with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to share this message around, so that as many people can join in as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/03/31/tdov-2020">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/31/transgender-day-of-visibility/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, 31 March is International Transgender Day of Visibility, an annual event to celebrate transgender people and raise awareness of the discrimination they face worldwide. Transgender, or trans, is an umbrella term used to describe those whose gender identity is different from the sex recorded at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identity and expression are central to the way we see ourselves and engage in the world around us. Visibility is important to make sure that the needs of trans people are met, discrimination is addressed, and individuals are not left feeling marginalised, alone and isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trans visibility is also important for parents, carers and friends of young trans people.  If a child or loved one is struggling with their gender identity, it’s important that we know where to turn for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agender-staff-network&quot;&gt;a:gender staff network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transgender Day of Visibility is a time to share and uplift the voices of our trans community and to renew our efforts to build working environments that are inclusive and supportive of trans colleagues, ensuring that they are treated with the same levels of respect and fairness as everyone else. This includes, for example, respecting and using everyone’s preferred name and pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done much in the Civil Service over recent years to raise awareness of the issues faced by our trans and non-binary colleagues, driven on by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agender.org.uk/&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt;, the cross-government staff network supporting trans, non-binary and intersex employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our key achievements in the last 12 months has been the launch of a model Gender Identity and Intersex policy package, which is available to Civil Service HR departments to support them in creating cultures and working practices which are inclusive for, and supportive of civil servants of all gender identities. Several departments have already adopted the package in full, and more are currently working towards adopting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;year-of-inclusion&quot;&gt;Year of Inclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 is the Civil Service Year of Inclusion. Individuals feel included if they have a sense of belonging in their organisation; they are able to bring their authentic self to work, and they have a voice in their organisation. It is the Civil Service ambition to be the most inclusive employer in the UK. It is my ambition, as Civil Service LGB&amp;amp;TI Champion, that the Civil Service should be the most LGB&amp;amp;TI-inclusive employer in the UK, so that we establish working environments where lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex civil servants feel included, safe and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sense of inclusion is particularly important in these times of social distancing, which can so easily become social isolation, and we all have a part to play in ensuring all our colleagues feel included and connected. Bear in mind that for some LGB&amp;amp;TI people it is difficult to be their authentic selves at home and in their communities, and an inclusive workplace can be somewhere where they do feel safe. Our departmental and cross-government networks have a vital role to play in maintaining a sense of belonging and countering the isolation experienced while physically separated from the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am proud of what we have achieved so far, due to the hard work of LGBT+ staff networks in departments and civil service organisations, of the cross-government staff networks a:gender and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, of departmental LGB&amp;amp;TI Champions, and of LGB&amp;amp;TI civil servants and their allies. But I am aware that there is always more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent People Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of trans civil servants than their colleagues say they have experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination: we need to work to understand why that is happening and find ways to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saluting-trans-colleagues&quot;&gt;Saluting trans colleagues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue working with departments, supported by a:gender and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, to improve the experiences of our trans non-binary and intersex colleagues. Senior Civil Servants need to show leadership in this respect, but every civil servant has a part to play: treating all your colleagues with respect and dignity, and making sure your workplace is a safe and supportive environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ‘visibility’ becomes harder for all of us in the current climate, let us all pause for a moment today to salute the courage and achievements of trans women, trans men and non-binary colleagues, who have been prepared to take the risks involved in being visible role models in the Civil Service, and who have contributed so much to the Civil Service and to wider society.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/02/17/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout">&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Department Network Leads who attended or dialled in to our Leaders of Networks forum on Thursday 4th February. It was a useful discussion and we look forward to working with you over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please find below a brief note of the meeting. The team will be in contact with attendees to follow up on any actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-lgbti-champion-update&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGB&amp;amp;TI Champion update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Slater updated the group on his first year in the role and highlighted that his priorities for this year will focus on microaggressions, bullying and harassment. He noted he was looking into arranging a meeting with other permanent secretaries on how they can make improvements across the Civil Service for LGBT+ colleagues from the people survey data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cslgbt-network-achievements-and-priorities-for-2020&quot;&gt;CSLGBT+ Network achievements and priorities for 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the network set up the Network of Leaders forum, carried out an analysis of departments submissions to the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index [WEI], had a presence at Prides around the country and a float at Pride in London. We set up BiSpace, created a bisexuality fact sheet and through our regional reps more networking events were established outside of London. The network also had engagement with Civil Service HR on LGBT+ training throughout the employee lifecycle. 
In addition, the network attended a meeting with the No10 policy unit in December, along with Jonathan Slater and the agender network. This was to discuss how we can use our networks and champion roles to help with LGBT+ inclusive policy across government. 
In 2020, the network plans to expand our pride presence throughout the regions, develop the WEI work with the CSD&amp;amp;I team, focus on intersectionality and launch a Civil Service version of the GEO LGBT survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stonewall-workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network congratulated the Ministry of Justice and Welsh Government for their top 10 place in the Workplace Equality Index. A further congratulations was extended to the other networks with departments/agencies placed in the top 100, a full list can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stonewall.org.uk/full-list-top-100-employers-2019&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; 
The group were updated on the work going on around Stonewall WEI. It was noted that an analysis had been undertaken using departments feedback from the 2019 submissions. This piece of work has been useful in sharing good practice amongst departments, while also collating useful data to assist other departments in seeking guidance from others. 
The group discussed the inconsistencies with scores of the submissions and the value of the WEI amongst the different departments. It was noted that there is a variance between departments on who completes the submission (the network and HR). The group were advised on the on-going working group led by Civil Service HR on common issues across the board such as procurement and learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-of-working&quot;&gt;Ways of working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network agreed to provide guidance to network chairs on our working processes and how we can use our platforms (website and mailing list) to better assist department networks reach a wider audience. It was reiterated that we are a volunteer led group and our capacity varies at times. Membership to the CSLGBT+ network is individual, but we also exist to support departmental networks through our contact networks, by helping departments to collaborate, share events and best practice across the Civil Service. 
It was agreed the Leaders of Network forum should take place quarterly, focusing on common issues that we can use to the time to discuss. Each network agreed to circulate the top three things they need help with, and the top three things they are good at. Once network leads have sent this over to us we will collate it and form a forward look. 
To ensure everyone is kept up to date, the network advised chairs to sign up to our network mailing list, so they receive communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lgbt-history-month&quot;&gt;LGBT+ History Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network updated the group on cross government events happening over LGBT+ history month and invited departments to share any open events with us to post on our website. Please check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events&quot;&gt;website for the latest events.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pride&quot;&gt;Pride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network will bid for a place at Pride in London, while supporting a more organic grassroots presence across the UK at other prides. We are able to provide t-shirts and placards to regional reps. We will continue with our pink branding to reduce costs and maximise visibility. The network will also look to have a presence at Black Pride and Bi Pride. 
The network notified other network leads that they could bid for Pride in London tickets, through their department and pool these centrally with the CSLGBT+ network to increase our capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aob&quot;&gt;AOB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is looking to provide more focused support for allies. Therefore, we are interested to hear from departmental networks about their thoughts and ideas on how we can work towards this goal. We will also be bringing back Allies Week in the coming months with more details to follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks Forum is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network, it exists to share news of what the Civil Service LGBT+ Network is doing and to give departmental LGBT+ network leaders a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/10/04/vice-chair-coordinator/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Applications open until 11:59pm, Friday 18 October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is led entirely by volunteers. Currently around 50 volunteers from across government are involved in delivering our projects, running our events, and representing your views to senior leaders in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coordinator is a vice-chair position and is part of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s Committee. Alongside the chair and other vice-chairs, you will coordinate our work and volunteers, develop our strategic plans, and lead on specific projects. If you’re looking for a stretching volunteer role that can make a difference in the Civil Service, then this is the role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent expansion of the LGBT+ Network Committee has highlighted the need for someone specific to be responsible for arranging routine meetings, providing effective oversight of the network mailbox, and managing the information stored/produced by the Network.  In addition, this role is designed to have some flexibility in it, allowing the post-holder to lead on or contribute to important short-term projects that need to be delivered quickly e.g. Pride events, creation of innovative campaigns etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this role, you will help the Network to manage its engagement with departmental networks, its relationship with its volunteers, and help to drive the delivery of projects. Due to the role’s flexibility, it is also a varied role which will allow you to work on a range of projects you are passionate about and develop new skills. It’s a great opportunity to really contribute to making a difference to the experiences of LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our constitution doesn’t specify how these roles need to be constituted, nor does it require an election, so we’ll be appointing the roles through fair and open competition. Find out more about what the role involves, and how to apply, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for the role you will need to submit a personal statement to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your personal statement should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be no fewer than 500 words and no more than 1,000 words long&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain why you want to be a vice-chair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain what skills and experience you can bring to the role, in line with the role description below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain how you would approach the task of managing a virtual team of volunteers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-deadline&quot;&gt;Application deadline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on Friday 18th October. Late applications will not be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications will be marked on a 1 to 7 scale, as used in standard Civil Service recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you score above the minimum pass mark, you will be invited to interview in late October and will commence the role from November/December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;role-description&quot;&gt;Role description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a vice-chair you will work as part of a small senior team responsible for the day-to-day running of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. You, as Coordinator, will be responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;managing the shared mailbox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;arranging routine meetings, ensuring venues, phone conferencing and agendas are all available in advance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tracking actions and delivery against them from meetings, escalating concerns to the project lead or the Network Chair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning and executing discrete projects that meet the strategic objectives of the Network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;representing the Network to senior stakeholders across government, to Civil Service HR colleagues and to local departmental networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regularly communicating about your work in an open and transparent manner via our website and social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vice-chair role can be demanding, and you should expect to spend at least two or three hours a week on Network activity. Whilst line managers are encouraged to provide you with facility time to undertake this work, you may need to use some of your own time to undertake the role too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role is entirely voluntary, but reasonable expenses can usually be paid for costs incurred whilst undertaking network activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;kate.hughes@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is led entirely by volunteers. Currently around 50 volunteers from across government are involved in delivering our projects, running our events, and representing your views to senior leaders in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bi+ Inclusion Lead is a vice-chair position and is part of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s Committee. Alongside the chair and other vice-chairs, you will coordinate our work and volunteers, develop our strategic plans, and lead on specific projects. If you’re looking for a stretching volunteer role that can make a difference in the Civil Service, then this is the role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil servants identifying as “bisexual” or “other” consistently report lower engagement and lower wellbeing than their gay, lesbian and heterosexual colleagues. They are also more likely to report being a victim of bullying, harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this a bit further, we did some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and listened to civil servants across the country who identified with a range of identities, particularly: bisexual, queer, pansexual and asexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this role, you will represent this diverse group, and develop and deliver clear objectives in order to improve the experiences of this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our constitution doesn’t specify how these roles need to be constituted, nor does it require an election, so we’ll be appointing the roles through fair and open competition. Find out more about what the role involves, and how to apply, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a vice-chair you will work as part of a small senior team responsible for the day-to-day running of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. You, as Bi+ Inclusion Lead, will be responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leading a team of 6-10 volunteers, including supporting a specific lead on asexual inclusion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assessing available evidence and listening to the perspectives of bisexual, queer, pansexual, and asexual civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing strategic objectives that will improve the experiences of this group in the long-term&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning and executing discrete projects that meet these strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;representing the Network to senior stakeholders across government, to Civil Service HR colleagues and to local departmental networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regularly communicating about your work in an open and transparent manner via our website and social media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on the work of the previous Bi+ Inclusion Lead, you might like to continue distributing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/bi-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;Bi Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;, run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2018/09/30/join-us-at-bispace&quot;&gt;BiSpace&lt;/a&gt; events, and support your team of volunteers to run the BiSpace Facebook group. However, there is also scope to shape this role yourself and set your own agenda based on the evidence and needs of this diverse group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vice-chair role can be demanding, and you should expect to spend at least two or three hours a week on Network activity.

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/09/18/john-peart-stepping-down/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Network vice-chair stepping down" />
			<published>2019-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2019-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/09/18/john-peart-stepping-down/">&lt;p&gt;At the end of this month, I’ll be stepping down from my role as vice-chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been involved in leading the cross-government LGBT network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; first as part of the communications team, then as a member of CSRA’s board, and more recently leading the network as a whole with Kate. Now, after 6 years doing things to make the Civil Service a great place to work for LGBT+ people, it’s time for fresh ideas, new faces, and — for me — new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate and I took over running the Network around 2 years ago, when the previous Chair, Ollie, stepped down. Since then, we’ve delivered a lot of activity — and I’m proud of what we’ve done, and what I’ve led.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lots-to-be-proud-of&quot;&gt;Lots to be proud of&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we took over, we have greatly &lt;strong&gt;expanded our national presence&lt;/strong&gt;, making sure that our activities and events don’t only happen in London. We’ve supported a new, large volunteer team to establish regular socials in Bristol, Cardiff Edinburgh, Manchester and Leeds for the first time. This year alone we will have hosted &lt;strong&gt;50 social events&lt;/strong&gt; across the whole of the UK; more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also launched a range of exciting campaigns and initiatives, including &lt;strong&gt;BiSpace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service Allies Week&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, these have been volunteer led, brilliantly executed and it’s been fantastic to see them develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve strengthened our network engagement, by establishing our quarterly &lt;strong&gt;Heads of Networks&lt;/strong&gt; forums; giving a chance for feedback, development and debate of issues affecting networks across government. We’ve also kept growing. In fact, we’re nearing a pretty significant milestone — we’ll soon have 2,000 direct members; more than 10 times the number of people that were engaged with the network when I joined back in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, we’ve delivered our biggest and boldest &lt;strong&gt;Pride&lt;/strong&gt; seasons ever. (&lt;em&gt;And I think it’s fair to say that this year, in particular, I outdid myself with our float!&lt;/em&gt;). Not only that, but we’ve put our network’s Pride activity on a sustainable footing, having secured a commitment from Civil Service leadership to continue these activities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-do-it-because-its-important&quot;&gt;We do it because it’s important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years, we have all put a lot of our own time, effort and energy into making all of this happen; just as those came before us did, and those that come after me will. That hard work has paid off though, with a more vibrant and diverse network of people involved than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pretty thankless task, most of the time. It’s difficult. It’s time consuming. It’s hard to keep everyone happy. But we all keep doing it; we do it because it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is not an inclusive place for LGBT+ people, and whilst the Civil Service is a better place than most, the same problems still exist as they always have. It’s important we keep up the work of cross-government and departmental networks, to ensure we keep chipping away at the big problems LGBT+ civil servants face at home and at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-luck&quot;&gt;Good luck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate will shortly be giving an update on changes to the team, and some fresh faces. I’ll finish by saying “thank you” to the dozens of civil servants I’ve worked with over the last 6 years;  and good luck to those who will keep carrying the flag.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/08/29/health-policy-fast-track/">&lt;p&gt;The Health Policy Fast Track Scheme (HPFTS) is DHSC’s accelerated development scheme for high potential staff with an interest in health policy. The Scheme launched in 2018 with an internally-recruited Pilot cohort, and the first externally-recruited cohort are due to join the department in September 2019. Participants are selected on ability, potential and passion for improving health and social care policy, and as such represent the health and social care leaders of the future. The Scheme has some similarities to Fast Stream but focuses more on the specific health and social care policy skills needed and how we work the NHS and our Arm’s Length Bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scheme consists of up to four placements across three years, in policy roles, private office or similar corporate roles, and in an Arm’s Length Body (ALB) or the NHS. Participants begin in HEO-level roles, aiming to progress to Grade 7 standard by the end of the scheme. Alongside their placements, participants are offered a variety of learning and development opportunities including an Msc in Health Policy, policy and personal impact courses, mentoring, coaching and senior sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications for the September 2020 intake will open in October, so if you or anyone you know would be interested in applying, please keep an eye out on the NHS training scheme website and CS Jobs for further information on how to apply. We are happy to offer adjustments to the application process as required. If you have any queries, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hpfts.operations@dhsc.gov.uk&quot;&gt;hpfts.operations@dhsc.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/07/25/bi-visiibility-event/">&lt;p&gt;On 10th July we had the pleasure of hosting a Bi+ Visibility and Intersectionality event in London. The event was well attended, including by senior guest speakers Emily Miles and Jonathan Slater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily spoke movingly about her personal experiences and the importance of not being afraid to bring all your identities to the fore in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/09/19/emily-miles-why-i-declare-my-diversity/&quot;&gt;Read Emily’s story in her own words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily has also appeared in our video series Civil Service Rainbow Alliance Talks, in the Bisexuality edition, alongside other Bi+ civil servants sharing their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/09/19/watch-csra-talks-bisexuality/&quot;&gt;Watch the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Slater is the Permanent Secretary for DfE and is the Civil Service LGBTI Diversity and Inclusion Champion. He was also named Stonewall Senior Champion of the Year, 2019. Jonathan was keen to hear our views on Bi+ inclusion in the Civil Service and our thoughts on ways to improve visibility and reduce biphobia. He spoke enthusiastically about the importance of championing LGBT+ and intersectional issues and the progress the Civil Service has made and is still striving to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2019/04/29/civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-champion/&quot;&gt;Read more about Jonathan’s appointment as LGBTI Champion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared our own stories and challenges around feeling visible in spaces that are not always accepting or acknowledging of Bi+ and intersectional identities. Continuing on to lunch after the event, we bonded as friends, and shared with one another the sense that there is a safe space for Bi+ individuals, and that we can now feel just a little more empowered to take our whole selves into our working lives.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/06/30/mark-lambert-pride-blog/">&lt;p&gt;My name is Mark Lambert – I am  the local DWPride&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rep for Oxford Job Centre Plus and have being doing this role since January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Oxford Job Centre I have organised dress down days, cake sales, brightest clothes completion to raise funds for Oxford Pride as well has having them over to talk about why groups such as Oxford Pride are still valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasions though, being the local DWPride site rep, I do get asked some “interesting” questions and receive the odd remark. I thought I’d share some of them with you, to show you what it’s like being a civil servant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-have-equality-in-law-so-why-do-you-need-groups-such-as-dwpride&quot;&gt;“You have equality in law so why do you need groups such as DWPride?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get asked this a lot; I explain that our LGBT+ network, DWPride, is there to offer support to LGBT+ colleagues and their allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics show that despite equality in law, people feel and still do suffer from discrimination in and out at work. This needs to be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use evidence about LGBT+ people’s experiences to point out that the number of reported LGBT+ hate crimes is rising, and that many anti-LGBT+ hate crimes and incidents go unreported, with younger LGBT+ people particularly reluctant to go to the police. According to Stonewall, three-in-ten LGBT+ people avoid certain streets because they do not feel safe there as an LGBT person, while more than two-thirds of respondents to the Government’s National LGBT Survey said they don’t feel comfortable walking down the street while holding their same-sex partner’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arent-groups-like-dwpride-just-divisive-and-competing-for-special-treatment&quot;&gt;“Aren’t groups like DWPride just divisive and competing for special treatment?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is always an interesting discussion. I explain that we are not asking for any  preferential laws or treatment, nor are trying to be divisive. I explain that what we do is offer support and encouragement and ask for LGBT+ people to be respected for who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-dress-up-as-a-rainbow&quot;&gt;“Do you dress up as a rainbow?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, seriously; someone did ask this! Sadly I have never felt the need to dress up as a rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-not-all-bad&quot;&gt;It’s not all bad!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the above I do, and have, received very welcome support from my colleagues and from my Trade Union, PCS. I’ve also received support from senior managers — like my Director of Counter Fraud Compliance &amp;amp; Debts, and my line manager who has always assisted and encouraged me in this role, so I do feel I can be me in DWP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/06/30/joe-tetley-pride-blog/">&lt;p&gt;This year is the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots; so for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23civilservicepride&quot;&gt;#CivilServicePride&lt;/a&gt; season, I thought I’d share my first Pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-first-pride&quot;&gt;My First Pride&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, I was living in Bristol and decided to go to my first pride event in London.  I had been &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; ‘out’ for 2 years, although I hadn’t yet told my family, so really I still had one foot in the closet.  I was also very nervous going into places on my own in the city centre or being seen and beaten up.  I went down the night before and stayed with a straight mate in Stoke Newington intending to go to the after parade event at Clapham Common, although I wasn’t totally convinced by the line up of Jimmy Somerville, Chrystal Rose, Boy George, The Beverley Sisters, Bananarama and the Happy Clappers (who?).  It was only a year since I had cut my hair and lost the grungy look which went with my music tastes but not my new lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we went out for a curry and a few pints, my friends were encouraging me to go on the march itself before going to Clapham Common telling me I’d come all this way, I might as well do the whole thing.  I wasn’t convinced about this, conscious of media and being publicly out there, I said I’d sleep on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I got up and decided to go, my friends offered to come with me but I said no, I needed to do this on my own.  I made my way to Hyde Park and found masses of people congregating together and getting ready for the March to start.  I didn’t know what to do, everyone seemed to be in groups and had banners or flags - I was just alone with nothing to wave or hold.  I wandered along the lines of people thinking I would just stand at the back where no-one could notice me.   As I walked along I saw a group of people from a pub called the Griffin in Bristol (which was always scary to go into as the door is on a corner and everyone would turn around as you walked in).  They smiled at me, so I asked if I could walk with them as I was on my own.  “Of course” was the immediate response and a placard was thrust into my hand, I felt uncomfortable – one of the guys noticed and said “here – I can hold that”.
As we marched along, I felt excited and empowered, suddenly there were thousands of people like me and they weren’t afraid to be seen or be who they were.  Towards the end of the parade I bumped into my ex-girlfriend from Bristol with a group of friends she’d been at UEA with.  We were still on speaking terms and we all went for a drink.  I started getting on like a house on fire with one of her friends in particular, Brian, who like me, turned out to be single.  We made our way to Clapham Common and met up with the friends I was staying with.  I felt awkward now as they were asking if I wanted them to go into Clapham Common with me and really I just wanted to go with Brian.  They got this and could see there was some chemistry going on, so they left me to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was brilliant I had an absolutely fab time with Brian and even enjoyed some of the music – Jimmy Somerville belting out “You are my World” at your first pride is something to remember.  When it was all over and we left the park, I burst into tears.  Brian was concerned thinking he had done something to upset me, “you haven’t”, I said “I just don’t want today to end”.  It was the first time I could remember feeling like I was normal and I didn’t need to be scared of who I was.  Brian got that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s why Pride is important to me, it will always hold a special place in my heart.  These days my favourite part of the weekend here in Manchester is being in the parade and seeing all the people supporting us.  Whilst some people complain about prices for events now or that it’s lost its meaning, for someone out there, it will be their first pride and I hope that they get to feel what I felt that day 23 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and Brian?  We went out for a few months but we couldn’t do long distance but we’re still friends and he came to my wedding last year!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/06/13/socials-in-the-south-west/">&lt;p&gt;Back in November 2017, we held our first Civil Service LGBT+ Network social in Bristol for the first time in almost two years. It’s been really great to meet so many people from other departments, but we quickly realised that our socials were clashing with other popular LGBT+ events in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure as many people can get involved as possible, we launched a questionnaire at the beginning of May to find out what our you would like to see in the South West. Here are the main things we found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d like to meet on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second week of the month works best for more people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d like to meet at an LGBT or LGBT+ friendly venue around Cabot Circus and Old Market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’d like us to organise some extra events like quiz nights and theatre trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve taken all your responses on board and are acting on some right away! We’ll also be putting some thought into how best we organise some extra bits too, so keep an eye out for updates in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To re-launch our South West events, we will be having our next social during Bristol Pride week on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-11-bristol-social/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday 11 July 2019&lt;/strong&gt; at The Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;. Your regional organisers, Andrew Cowler from Ofsted and Katharine Sendell from the Cabinet Office will be there from 5pm to greet you – and hopefully we’ll be able to sit in the garden if the weather is good. If you’re worried about coming along on your own, you can bring a colleague because allies are always welcome or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in contact with us&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to meet us beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire will stay open so that even more people can tell us what they want and we can keep adapting to what’s best for you. If you haven’t already had your say, &lt;a href=&quot;LINK: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nScIp4jeYkuVYIWmvowIzFDh8q-FHORFrjJvXGTirHZUREoxWDRXSU1WUDFQS0xDNjFDR0g5OTBQNy4u&quot;&gt;complete the survey&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to share it with other civil servants in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a list of future events across the country on the &lt;a href=&quot;/events/&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network website&lt;/a&gt; and remember to join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/2409606785735978/&quot;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for all the latest updates and events in the South West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you on 11 July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew and Katharine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;50 years ago this month, a riot at a bar in New York — the Stonewall Inn — sparked a LGBT rights movement, and kickstarted annual pride protests around the world. This year, we’re once again taking part in pride events across the UK — and celebrating this important milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For Pride this year, we’re reminding everyone why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work. Use these posters to highlight your pride in the Civil Service, and to highlight 50 years of Pride.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/06/01/civil-service-pride-season-starts-now/">&lt;p&gt;50 years ago this month, a riot at a bar in New York — the Stonewall Inn — sparked a LGBT rights movement, and kickstarted annual pride protests around the world. This year, we’re once again taking part in pride events across the UK — and celebrating this important milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-part-in-prides-across-the-uk&quot;&gt;Take part in Prides across the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve secured funding to take part in 6 pride events across the UK, organised by us at the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-06-15-pride-in-edinburgh/&quot;&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;: 22 June 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-06-pride-in-london/&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;: 6 July 2019 (Currently full)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-20-northern-pride-newcastle/&quot;&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;: 20 July&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-03-pride-belfast/&quot;&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;: 3 August 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-24-pride-cymru-cardiff/&quot;&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;: 24 August 2019
2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-09-28-pride-preston/&quot;&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt;: 28 September 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some departmental networks are also organising attendance at other pride events, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liverpool: 27 July 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can register to attend these events by &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9&quot;&gt;completing our registration form&lt;/a&gt;. All events, except Pride in London, still have spaces and registrations are open until 2 weeks prior to each event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re organising a walking group at a Pride event, and it isn’t listed above, please &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be happy to add it to our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t-shirts-banners-and-placards&quot;&gt;T-shirts, banners and placards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are joining us at one of the events listed above, we will be able to provide you with a Civil Service Pride t-shirt, free of charge. We will email you to ask for your size and your address around 2 weeks before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be able to loan banners and placards to you if you’re organising a walking group at these locations or elsewhere. Just &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-inclusive-place-to-work&quot;&gt;An inclusive place to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pride this year, we’re reminding everyone why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;share-your-story&quot;&gt;Share your story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Pride season, we want you to share your story. Write a blog post for us, and tell us what an inclusive Civil Service looks like to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your blog post and a picture of yourself to us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll post as many as we can over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;civilservicepride&quot;&gt;#CivilServicePride&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can show your #CivilServicePride on social media too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your pictures from Pride events, and tell us why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title type="html">What happened at the second Leaders of Networks Forum</title>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/05/26/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout/">&lt;p&gt;Last month, we hosted our second Leaders of Networks Forum, this post shares some of the highlights from the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks Forum is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network, it exists to share news of what the Civil Service LGBT+ Network is doing and to give departmental LGBT+ network leaders a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; Leaders of Networks Forum is on 11 July 2019. Find out more on our &lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-07-11-leaders-of-networks-forum/&quot;&gt;events page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pride-2019&quot;&gt;Pride 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with the hot topic of Pride which generated a lot of lively debate around which Pride events we should be supporting. I outlined the work that CSLGBT+ Network had done with Sue Owen and the CSD&amp;amp;I team to drive the business case for central funding for Pride events. The funding has been agreed by Permanent Secretaries for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cardiff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Belfast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Newcastle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be supporting other events but not funding them as they aren’t part of the business case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride in London is the most complex to organise with the earliest deadlines so that has a focus right now, we have managed to secure a large float and a walking group and we have run a ticket lottery so we can confirm who does have a ticket early enough to make appropriate arrangements. (The allocations will be sent to those that entered the lottery next week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of people getting tickets and then not turning up was raised. This year we are going to be letting people know well in advance and the group agreed that anyone who doesn’t attend and wastes a ticket won’t be eligible to get a ticket for the next two years. We also discussed that the group needs to be more obviously diverse than it has in previous years as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be putting details of the Pride celebrations that we are supporting on the &lt;a href=&quot;/events/&quot;&gt;Events webpage&lt;/a&gt; so keep an eye out there. If you’re organising something for a pride event and you want us to advertise it &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-lgbt-survey&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we moved on to the survey that we are planning to run to get more information on the workplace experiences of LGBT+ civil servants. This builds upon the results of the Civil Service People Survey and the National LGBT Survey so we can get more information on exactly how LGBT+ civil servants feel and how we benchmark against the rest of the public sector (from the National LGBT Survey). There was an interesting discussion around what it would be useful to include from a cross-government perspective and from a departmental perspective, our next steps are to look at the survey questions and identify what we are going to include in the survey before launching it later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-awards&quot;&gt;Civil Service Awards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards; nominations for that closed 1st May. The D&amp;amp;I Awards give us a chance to remind ourselves of what we are really good at and celebrate the individuals, teams and networks up and down the country who are doing great work on LGBT+ issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two categories of particular interest were the Championing LGBTI Inclusion Award and the Employee Network Excellence Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also going to be feeding back on the process to the Civil Service D&amp;amp;I team as part of a review in advance of next year’s awards, any comments please &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;email them to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-live&quot;&gt;Civil Service Live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have workshops at each of the Civil Service Live events this year. We’re looking for local civil servants to help facilitate these (LGBT+ and well informed allies), we are also looking for LGBT+ civil servants to support this. For more information please read our recent &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/05/02/Civil-Service-Live&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stonewall-workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section of the meeting focussed on the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index. We have three separate working groups across government working on this at the moment, one being run by Jonathan Slater, one by the Civil Service D&amp;amp;I team and one by us. We agreed to set up a meeting in the next few weeks between the network leaders to look at this in more detail and identify what the barriers are to disclosing results across government, where we can identify good practice and what the next steps should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We held a Network Leaders meeting on 20th May to look at this from a CSLGBT+ Network and departmental networks perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;honours&quot;&gt;Honours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a discussion around the Honours system and agreed that it would be good to nominate more LGBT+ civil servants and allies who have done work on LGBT+ issues through both their civil service roles and in a voluntary capacity. To nominate someone, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/honours/nominate-someone-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;hr /&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bisexuality means attraction to more than one gender.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what is it like to be bisexual in the workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, we want everyone to feel included and valued for who they are. However, we know bisexual civil servants feel less included than their gay and heterosexual peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Bisexual civil servants&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;As a result, we are&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Want a greater sense of community, having felt excluded from both ‘straight’ and‘LGBT+’spaces.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Running dedicated, social and supportive events and an online community space for bisexual civil servants.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Feel invisible as a result of a lack of recognition and role models in the workplace and wider society.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Raising the profile of bisexual civil servants, including senior role models, departmental LGBT+ networks, and HR teams to monitor, recognise and support minority sexual identities.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Face negative stereotypes, assumptions, a lack of understanding about their identities, and intrusive questions.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Providing knowledge information and support to individuals, networks and departments.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Are more likely to experience bullying, discrimination and harassment.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Investigating how training and guidance can be developed or improved with in the wider Civil Service and also within LGBT+ spaces.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Can face multiple barriers to full participation in the workplace, due to other aspects of their lives and identities in interaction with their sexual orientation.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Working with other Civil Service diversity networks and organising joint initiatives.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bisexual&lt;/strong&gt; means attraction to more than one gender.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pansexual&lt;/strong&gt; means attraction to all genders or attraction to people regardless of gender.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some people are comfortable with both labels and may use them interchangeably. Other are only comfortable using one term. It is important to respect a person’s identity and how they choose to describe themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-allies-do&quot;&gt;What can Allies do?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies avoid making assumptions about a person’s sexual orientation or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies make space so that the quiet/unnoticed/missing voices can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies consider their own behaviour; ask for feedback, reflect, adapt and learn how to be have in ways that invite people in, instead of pushing them away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies challenge constructively when they see something going wrong – an inappropriate comment or an interaction that is failing to build relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies follow the appropriate bullying and harassment procedure if they become aware of biphobic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies take into account that every bi experience is different and does not solely define a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allies inform themselves and seek sources of information independently rather than assuming minority colleagues are there to inform them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In society, bi women can often be fetishised. Bi men can be stereotyped as being closeted gay
men.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“It can be challenging to explain that it’s a sexuality that exists beyond the gender of your partner, that you’re not flipping between two binary states.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“It can be a struggle of being not quite gay enough or not quite straight, resulting in exclusion and feeling like you don’t quite belong anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“I have been seeing someone of the same sex for quite some time… I am incredibly hesitant to reveal this and constantly feel like I can’t be my true self at work.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“I feel completely comfortable and have been out from starting in the Civil Service one year ago. Everyone in my team has behaved completely appropriately, as if it is no big deal - which for me, it isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, the work we are doing to support bi+ civil servants, and information about our BiSpace events on our website, &lt;a href=&quot;//www.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;BiSpace is an initiative run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants.
(‘Bi+’ encompassing bi, pan, ace, queer)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s a chance to meet fellow bisexual, pansexual, queer and asexual civil servants in different parts of the country, particularly London, Bristol and Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sign up to the mailing list at &lt;a href=&quot;//www.civilservice.lgbt/join-us&quot;&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt/join-us&lt;/a&gt; to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I tell my colleagues I went to visit my girlfriend last weekend, they may assume that I identity as lesbian. It could he uncomfortable to have to add ‘but I’m also attracted to men’, or ‘I’ve also had male partners’, or even ‘but I’m not gay I’m bi’. It’s important to avoid making assumptions about someone’s sexuality if they have not explicitly come out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“I feel like I’m constantly managing where people are on the basis of my relationship with them – what they know, how comfortable I feel, what version of myself to put out in those different contexts, how safe do I feel with this person, how much of myself do I show? It is exhausting.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know why it matters but I don’t want to be misrecognised as something that I am not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“It’s the repetitive process of coming out to the same people, again and again and again.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bi Visibility Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bi Visibility Day is on 23 September every year. The day celebrates the bisexual community, raises awareness of bisexuality, and highlights biphobia and bi-erasure. 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the day. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;//bivisibilityday.com&quot;&gt;bivisibilityday.com&lt;/a&gt; to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/05/22/introducing-new-bisexuality-fact-sheet/">&lt;p&gt;Today, the bi+ inclusion volunteer team is proud to launch our &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/bi-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;bisexuality factsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-use-the-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;How can I use the fact sheet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factsheet is designed to raise awareness of bisexuality and the experiences of bisexual people. You can help by distributing it with your colleagues and networks.
You may like to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send it to your team or directorate, including a link to this blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create space to discuss the factsheet at a team-meeting, away-day or in other relevant meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use it as an opportunity to engage with your HR Diversity and Inclusion Team, LGBT staff network, or senior LGBT Champion on how to create an inclusive work environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;print out some copies of the factsheet to leave in the communal areas of your workplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-a-factsheet&quot;&gt;Why do we need a factsheet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents to our 2017 consultation said that they often find themselves in a position where they are perceived as a source of knowledge on LGBT+ issues amongst their colleagues. Whilst an environment of open questions and peer-to-peer learning is a positive one, this put considerable strain on those individuals who may not have the information themselves, may not feel comfortable answering personal questions, and who are also trying to do their day job. They said this sense of strain was sometimes exacerbated by a well-intentioned desire to role model and do things for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support civil servants in these situations, we committed to developing a series of factsheets. These are intended to be shared by networks and HR functions in order to raise awareness of the full range of LGBT+ identities in the general workforce. They can also be used as a source of information which LGBT+ people can share with their colleagues in order to avoid answering all the questions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS LGBT+ Network intends this to be the first of several factsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bi-inclusion-volunteer-team&quot;&gt;The bi-inclusion volunteer team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After consulting colleagues across government to better understand the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, asexual and queer civil servants, we published &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;our strategic approach to improving the experiences of this group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve created a bi+ inclusion volunteer team to take forward this work, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/09/30/join-us-at-bispace&quot;&gt;launched BiSpace&lt;/a&gt;, run monthly bi socials and bi-inclusive LGBT socials across the country, and established a regular bi+ inclusion newsletter. Sign up to get the newsletter by ticking ‘Bisexual people’ on the &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us/&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network membership page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;This year the Civil Service Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion team are running sessions at each of the Civil Service Live events on Bullying Harassment and Discrimination and how it affects LGBTI people. We need your help as a facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facilitators&quot;&gt;Facilitators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would also like LGBTI civil servants to help with facilitation at their local Civil Service Live event. This is to ensure the conversation is relevant to LGBTI issues and not based on cis-het assumptions of LGBTI experiences. As a facilitator you won’t need to lead the discussion, just re-focus it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in facilitating at your local workshop please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:caroline.airs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;caroline.airs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/29/register-pride-in-london-deadline/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Update: Registrations now closed] Last chance to register for the Civil Service at Pride in London 2019" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/29/register-pride-in-london-deadline/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Registrations are now closed for the Civil Service group at Pride in London 2019. If you entered into the lottery, we will contact you about whether you do or do not have a place by 6 June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s Pride in London will be the biggest one yet, and we’re organising the Civil Service group in the parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaces are limited this year — we will have around 100 spots — so to ensure that everyone gets a fair chance to take part, we’re allocating spaces through a lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to join our parade group, you need to register by 14 May 2019.&lt;/strong&gt; To register your interest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9&quot;&gt;complete the registration form&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you tick ‘London’ when asked which events you want to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems – if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the lottery closes, we will allocate spaces to ensure there is a good mix of people from different backgrounds and departments in the parade. We will be allocating places by 1 June 2019. You will be emailed confirming your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t-shirts-and-placards&quot;&gt;T-shirts and placards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have secured funding to provide free t-shirts and merchandise to attendees. We will contact individuals about this once places are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partners-children-or-other-guests&quot;&gt;Partners, children or other guests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t guarantee entry for partners, children or other guests in the parade. Each person takes up a slot — and we have less spots to give out than last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Civil Service group — our priority is to allocate places to current civil servants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swapping-a-place&quot;&gt;Swapping a place&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to give your place to someone else, that’s fine. Just email us telling us before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-questions&quot;&gt;Other questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this process, you can email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that this inbox is staffed by volunteers and we get a lot of email – it might take a while to reply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only email us to ask for updates if the event you want to attend is less than 2 weeks away and you haven’t heard from us.&lt;/strong&gt; The more emails we receive, the less time we have to organise things for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can find out more about which Pride events we’re planning to attend in &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/01/pride-2019-what-you-need-to-know/&quot;&gt;our recent news post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/29/civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-awards/">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards are back for their 13th year. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/&quot;&gt;Nominations are open&lt;/a&gt; now and close on 3 May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can nominate any civil servant or Civil Service team for one of 8 different awards, including ‘Employee Network Excellence’ and ‘Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI) Inclusion’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the award, Chief People Officer and Diversity and Inclusion Awards Champion, Rupert McNeil said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is a great privilege to launch the 2019 Civil Service Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Awards are now in their 13th year, and it is incredibly inspiring to see the range of nominations each year, demonstrating all the passionate and creative work happening across government.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of my top priorities is for the Civil Service to be the UK’s most inclusive employer, representative of modern Britain and the public we serve. The Awards offer us a chance to recognise and champion those behaviours that build a more inclusive culture - ensuring fairness, making sure nothing holds our people back from making their best contribution, and making better decisions collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Being nominated for the Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion awards is recognition of the contribution and success of those colleagues who have gone out of their way to champion difference and make the Civil Service a better place to work. 
These awards provide an opportunity to showcase our success, both to colleagues and to wider society, and I strongly encourage you to participate. If you know of an individual or team doing outstanding work in this area, then please do nominate them. I know we will have an exciting list of nomination”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Rupert McNeil, Chief People Officer and Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Awards Champion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to nominate someone — do it now! The deadline is fast approaching. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/&quot;&gt;Diversity and Inclusion Awards website&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/15/positive-action-pathway-opens-soon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Applications for the Positive Action Pathway open soon" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/15/positive-action-pathway-opens-soon/">&lt;p&gt;The Positive Action Pathway (PAP) is a cross-government programme for colleagues in under-represented groups. The programme is specifically open to BAME, women, disabled and LGB&amp;amp;TI colleagues of all ages from AA to grade 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAP is a formal learning programme that lasts around 12 months and consists of various development workshops, action learning sets and self-directed learning. The programme is designed to prepare people to move to the next grade or more stretching roles within the Civil Service.  It aims to help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increase skills, knowledge and confidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;develop confidence to overcome barriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;compete on an equal footing for progression or places on Civil Service talent schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSL has recently undertaken a review of PAP, consulting with current and former participants, departments and networks, and made some changes to the programme. Key changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a simpler selection process that no longer uses online testing and incorporates the new CS behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduction to the start of the programme is via a launch call for participants and managers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to action learning sets to better support personal workplace development plans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shorter, more focused regional celebration events to celebrate successful completion of the programme, network and hear leaders from across the Civil Service share their stories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to the workshops to incorporate Success Profiles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;easy access to materials online to enable learners to download workbooks and access related learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Positive Action Pathway will launch for grades HEO/SEO (Band B2) on 3 May 2019. The application window will close at 17:00 on 24 May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on PAP, including guidance to help you decide if PAP is the right development programme for you, is available on the PAP pages on CSL and LPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note:&lt;/em&gt; The search function is currently unavailable on CSL so you will need to access PAP via the home page, click on ‘Talent &amp;amp; Development’ and then ‘Positive Action Pathway’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applicant guidance contains the information you need to help you to prepare your application, including a breakdown of the four behaviours you will be assessed on. You will be able to access the guidance from 12 April 2019 and even though you won’t be able to submit an application until 3 May 2019, you can use this time to prepare the evidence you need to support your examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviours you will be assessed on are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leadership, changing &amp;amp; improving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering at pace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing self and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also be required to provide evidence of your motivation for applying to PAP and how you plan to commit to the 12 month programme. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline so please make the most of the additional preparation time available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your department will have a single point of contact that can provide you with further information on PAP and advise if your department is undertaking any additional development to support PAP participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/04/15/my-cslgbt-volunteering-journey/">&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Matt. I work for the Department for Work and Pensions, based and I’m based in Manchester. I became involved in the &lt;em&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/em&gt; in October 2018. I wanted to share a bit about what I’ve done as a volunteer: hopefully it gives others the push to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I organised our first local event in November 2018. Three other people came along, after I’d initially put up posters and sent a mail out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started small, but we’re growing all the time. At the last two socials, around 15 people came. We now have over 80 contacts in the Manchester and North West area, and we’ve had a few from other areas pop along who were in the area for meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still reaching out to volunteers to organise events in their area — the North West is a huge region — and want everybody to feel our events are as accessible as possible. What I have been doing is sending posters across the various network groups to forward on to their North West colleagues so they have something  with the full year of dates to put staff rooms. That way, people new and old are aware something happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the North West region, I now have contacts at the British Council, Care Quality Commission, Department for Education, Disclosure and Barring, DWP, and Environment Agency — to name a few — so the messages are being shared in the background. Members are a mix of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and also members of &lt;a href=&quot;//agender.org.uk&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt;. Some have been in touch thanks to the CSLGBT+ Network’s BiSpace initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Manchester social events have just started in a new home for 12 months: The Goose, a small pub that has just been done up and not on the main stretch of the Manchester Village, so it’s a bit quieter. I’ve scheduled a regular day for the events to take place — the second Tuesday of each month. It won’t work for everybody, all the time, but keeping people informed has meant that even if can’t make it the community is still growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have met some amazing people and heard such great stories and gradually building up a supporting community, I know it’s an uphill battle to get the word out but don’t be afraid to ask for help and use the skills others can offer. Currently, we have people organising in Blackpool and talking with some other areas to see what we can arrange there and have been featured in the Home Office magazine ‘Spectrum’ so it has grown quite a lot in last few months and while slow progress it is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote to leave you with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I always wondered why somebody doesn’t do something about that. Then I realised I was somebody.” — &lt;em&gt;Lily Tomlin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/03/31/register-pride-2019/">&lt;p&gt;This year, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be taking part in a number of Prides across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about which Pride events we’re planning to attend in &lt;a href=&quot;/pride/&quot;&gt;our recent news post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;registrations-are-now-open&quot;&gt;Registrations are now open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registrations for all Pride events are now open&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pride-events-outside-london&quot;&gt;Pride events outside London&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pride events taking place outside of London, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9&quot;&gt;complete this form&lt;/a&gt; and you will be registered to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems – if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will send you final details for the event around 2 weeks in advance of the event date. We may also contact you before the event so that you can order t-shirts and other Pride materials for your local event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New location added:&lt;/strong&gt; Colleagues at the Home Office will be leading a Civil Service group at Liverpool Pride on 27 July 2019. If you’d like to join them, please register using the same form as all the other events — we’ve updated it to include this new location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pride-in-london&quot;&gt;Pride in London&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places in the Civil Service group for Pride in London will be allocated via a lottery. This is because places are limited in the parade and we want to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To register your interest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9&quot;&gt;complete the registration form&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you tick ‘London’ when asked which events you want to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems – if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will close registrations on 14 May 2019, and allocate places by 1 June 2019. We expect to be able to confirm your place no less than 4 weeks before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this process, you can email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that this inbox is staffed by volunteers and we get a lot of email – it might take a while to reply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only email us to ask for updates if the event you want to attend is less than 2 weeks away and you haven’t heard from us.&lt;/strong&gt; The more emails we receive, the less time we have to organise things for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">Applications closed: Become a vice chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/03/01/vice-chair-appointments/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Applications closed: Become a vice chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network" />
			<published>2019-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2019-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/03/01/vice-chair-appointments</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/03/01/vice-chair-appointments/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Applications have now closed. We will contact successful applicants soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is led entirely by volunteers. Currently around 50 volunteers from across government are involved in delivering our projects, running our events, and representing your views to senior leaders in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot of work. We want to make sure we can continue to deliver as a network which is why we’re decided to appoint some additional vice-chairs to our senior leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vice-chair is an important role that, alongside the chair, coordinates our work and volunteers, develops our strategic plans, and leads of specific projects. If you’re looking for a stretching volunteer role that can make a difference in the Civil Service, then this is the role for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our constitution doesn’t specify how these roles need to be constituted, nor does it require an election, so we’ll be appointing the roles through fair and open competition. Find out more about what the role involves, and how to apply, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for the role you will need to submit a personal statement to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your personal statement should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be no fewer than 500 words and no more than 1,000 words long&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain why you want to be a vice-chair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain what skills and experience you can bring to the role, in line with the role description below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explain what areas you would be interested in leading on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-deadline&quot;&gt;Application deadline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on 1 April 2019. Late applications will not be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications will be marked on a 1 to 7 scale, as used in standard Civil Service recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you score above the minimum pass mark, you will be invited to interview in late April and will commence the role from 1 May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;role-description&quot;&gt;Role description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a vice-chair you will work as part of a small senior team responsible for the day-to-day running of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. You will be jointly responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning and executing discrete projects on topics of interest to you and other volunteers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coordinating one or more groups of volunteers to deliver on projects outlined in our business plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;representing the Network to senior stakeholders across government, to Civil Service HR colleagues and to local departmental networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;regularly communicating about your work in an open and transparent manner via our website and social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vice-chair role can be demanding, and you should expect to spend at least two or three hours a week on Network activity. Whilst line managers are encouraged to provide you with facility time to undertake this work, you may need to use some of your own time to undertake the role too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role is entirely voluntary, but expenses can usually be paid for costs incurred whilst undertaking network activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">Sharing my identity</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/02/18/sunny-dermott-lgbt-history-month/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sharing my identity" />
			<published>2019-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2019-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/02/18/sunny-dermott-lgbt-history-month</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/02/18/sunny-dermott-lgbt-history-month/">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I remember reading an inspirational blog by Emily Miles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, about declaring that she was bisexual for the purposes of gathering organisational statistics.  Like Emily, I could easily have been presumed/assumed heterosexual – I generally look female, I have been married to a man, I am a mother.  But I have also dated women since I was 19, and no longer feel limited by binary perceptions of gender either for myself or my partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing as straight can be a double-edged sword. The weight of people’s assumptions can be significant, and bisexual* women suffer significantly poorer mental health than either straight women or lesbians. Involuntarily blending into the “straight” world when you are not straight is not a good place to be in. It feels dishonest.  Having assumptions made about your identity because perhaps you have an opposite sex partner, or don’t conform to a “gay” stereotype of how you present yourself, can be an awful cumulative burden of double discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of not fitting in at either side of the spectrum is belittled – “how can you be hurt by homophobia if you “look straight” or have an opposite sex partner?” (clue – you can).  Sometimes it can be difficult to even be recognised by the community that we belong to in spirit – to even be noticed by, and find potential partners of the same sex.  And sometimes there seems to be an expectation that we could just “make it easier for ourselves” and choose to be one thing or the other, as if bisexual&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; people should be expected to shut down part of their identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to let people who weren’t close to me assume what they liked for an easy life, and took on board a lot of internalised biphobia and inferiority, but after reading things like Emily’s blog and reaching out to other sources online and in books, I am now more confident in my identity and place in the LGBT community and the fact that this does not change, no matter the gender of my partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tick the “bisexual” box on our internal HR systems, happily in the knowledge that statistics on sexual orientation and other diversity strands are used for everyone’s benefit, to demonstrate and rectify where there are problems.  (I prefer the label pansexual though, as there’s more to life than “men” and “women”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that like Emily did for me, my ability to be out and visible might give some courage to other people that it’s OK to be yourself and you don’t have to fit into a neat category or meet narrow expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can watch Emily talk about this in our &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2016/09/19/watch-csra-talks-bisexuality/&quot;&gt;CSRA Talks Bisexuality video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/02/18/newsletter-system-error/">&lt;p&gt;On 18 February 2019, you might have received a newsletter from us that made very little sense. One of our event listings for an event in Cardiff was mistakenly sent to everyone on the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now fixed the error – and it shouldn’t happen again – but we just wanted to quickly say “sorry” for the accidental extra email!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-actually-happened&quot;&gt;What actually happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re technically minded, this is what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our newsletter is automatically generated based on the articles on our website; our email provider (MailChimp) takes an &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; from our website and generates a newsletter with any new articles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last week we uploaded a new event for International Women’s Day which the Welsh Government Network is running in Cardiff. Usually events don’t show up in the RSS feed, but there was a typo in the event’s title that meant it did show up; and that’s why you got the newsletter with a seemingly confused message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed the error now so that it won’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve added additional events on 21 February and 27 February, and amended some events in Cardiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT History Month is an annual celebration of LGBT history, culture and identities, marked each February in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s theme is “Peace, Activism and Reconciliation”, in recognition of 50 years since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots&quot;&gt;the Stonewall riots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network volunteers, and a number of local departmental networks, are organising events this February — some of them tied to History Month, and others just as part of our regular work. Come along and join the events. Here’s a quick run down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-02-05-bispace-london/&quot;&gt;BiSpace 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-02-05-bispace-manchester/&quot;&gt;BiSpace 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Manchester&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5 February 2019&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/02/06/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout/">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we hosted our first Leaders of Networks Forum — something we committed to in our business plan. In this post, I’ll share some highlights from the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Networks Forum is a new regular event that we’ve set up to help shape the work of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and give the leaders of local LGBT+ networks a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network in a department, agency or arm’s length body, or to anyone that volunteers with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network itself. At our first meeting, around a dozen networks and departments were represented, both in person and over the phone&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Here’s what we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcome-and-introductions&quot;&gt;Welcome and introductions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everyone had introduced themselves, I set out what the headers of Networks Forum was intended to do. We’re planning for the meetings to take place at least once a quarter, and for it to be open to everyone who helps run a Civil Service LGBT+ network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda will usually involve updates on cross-government delivery but also any other items networks might want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-on-network-delivery&quot;&gt;Update on Network delivery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved on to an update on our delivery against our business plan: and we’ve done quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;our business plan&lt;/a&gt; in June last year, following an open consultation on our strategy. The plan had four priority themes in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building strong and stable networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a diverse and inclusive community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a national impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding and representing your needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under each theme, we set out what we wanted to do. I gave an update on progress. Some highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;starting a team to look at ways networks can share best practice to support their Stonewall Workplace Equality Index rankings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;network volunteers organising participation in at least 6 Pride events in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;starting our new BiSpace initiative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launching the first Civil Service-wide Allies Week in October 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expanding our social events to more regions across the UK than ever before, whilst continuing to build on the success of our London events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;successfully influencing a number of Civil Service diversity and inclusion policy initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a number of questions at this stage; the most pertinent of which was about Pride 2019. We will be releasing more information about our plans for Pride later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bispace&quot;&gt;BiSpace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, our bisexuality lead, Mary, led a discussion an initiative we launched in September 2018 called BiSpace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary talked about some research she had conducted in late 2017, which looked at the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, asexual and queer civil servants. You can read more about the research in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;this summary report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary then spoke about some of the work that she, and a small team of volunteers, are leading to act on the findings. Principally, this includes a new community space for bi+ civil servants and a new fact-sheet that is being produced to help people understand more about bisexual employee’s experience in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BiSpace has now taken place in Bristol, London and Manchester twice; once in September for Bi Visibility Day, and once in February for LGBT History Month. There are also now monthly bi socials taking place in London, in advance of the usual cross-government socials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees had a wide ranging discussion about the work. In particular, there were requests for additional fact sheets beyond just bisexuality. This is something we’re going to look at doing once we have received feedback on the initial bisexuality fact sheets. The fact sheet should launch later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stonewall-workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stonewall Workplace Equality Index results were launched last month; a number of government organisations were featured in the Top 100. I led a discussion about how networks would like to act on the outcomes of the Index this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees said they would welcome the opportunity to meet up with other networks — either at one event or a series of events — looking at how to improve departmental practice, and subsequently improving departmental submissions. Attendees suggested that anyone who submitted to the Index this year that wished to take part in such an event should only be allowed to do so if they shared the content of their submissions with other attendees, which a majority of attendees appeared to support — though it was not unanimous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at facilitating this with our Stonewall volunteer team later this year, after networks have had their feedback sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-awards&quot;&gt;Civil Service Awards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Heaton, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Civil Service Awards Champion, has written to colleagues across government asking for feedback on the current format of the Civil Service Awards. Of particular relevance for LGBT staff is the format of the diversity and inclusion award, and it’s relationship to the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees briefly discussed whether there should be any changes to the awards. There were no strong opinions on the topic, but attendees did say they do not necessarily agree with the current format, where the winners of the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards become the shortlist for the diversity and inclusion award at the Civil Service Awards. Some attendees felt this puts different diverse groups in competition with each other in an unhelpful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be shortly writing to Richard Heaton with feedback; if you have any particular view on this issue, do &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-judgement-test&quot;&gt;Civil Service Judgement test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psychometric tests that are used by Civil Service Resourcing for the purposes of recruitment are being revised. The team responsible is looking for people willing to test the new formats, and provide feedback. Details will be circulated to network chairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-working&quot;&gt;Future working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared that there were around 50 to 70 volunteers involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network at the moment, and that this expanding volunteer team required additional leadership support to keep up with the growing volunteer base. As a result, Kate and I have decided to appoint some additional vice-chair roles to help lead the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2019/02/05/vice-chair-appointments&quot;&gt;information on the appointment process&lt;/a&gt; for this, if you are interested in becoming a vice-chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished by inviting any feedback on the meeting and any future agenda items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-meeting-agenda&quot;&gt;Full meeting agenda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Welcomes and introductions&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;15:00 to 15:15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Update on CS LGBT+ Network delivery&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;15:15 to 15:30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;BiSpace: what’s happened and what’s next&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;15:30 to 15:45&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Stonewall Workplace Equality Index results and discussion&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;15:45 to 16:00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Consultation on the Civil Service Awards&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16:00 to 16:15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Review of the Civil Service Judgement Test&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16:15 to 16:20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Future working&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16:20 to 16:35&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Any other business&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16:35 to close&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We were thwarted by departmental IT for this meeting; we know those dialling in had some issues, and we’re going to fix that for the next meeting. We want these meetings to be open to all, regardless of where you’re located. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve just added monthly events in Manchester, and upcoming events in Cardiff. You can find the details below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2019, and we’ve got &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of events planned for this year already. We’ve updated out &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;event listings&lt;/a&gt; page with provisional dates already; here’s a quick run down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;socials&quot;&gt;Socials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bristol&quot;&gt;Bristol&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2019, we’re introducing monthly socials in a new location: Bristol. Our volunteers in the area will be organising them for the &lt;strong&gt;first Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt; of each month, starting in February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-cardiff&quot;&gt;NEW: Cardiff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social events are being planned in Cardiff too; the first of which is on 20 February. You can get the details on &lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-02-20-cardiff-social/&quot;&gt;the social event page&lt;/a&gt;. Details for future socials will be added soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;edinburgh&quot;&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re slowly kicking off regular social events in Edinburgh. Our next one is on 6 February – and if there’s strong demand, our volunteers are happy to keep organising them. You can check out the details and get in touch with our local organiser, Steven, on the &lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-02-06-edinburgh-social/&quot;&gt;event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;london&quot;&gt;London&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we always, we’re holding regular socials in London from January 2019 through December 2019. They’ll be on the &lt;strong&gt;first Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; of each month. There’s no need to register, you can just turn up. The location for each event will be published on our website a few days in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-manchester&quot;&gt;NEW: Manchester&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now adding monthly socials in Manchester on the &lt;strong&gt;second Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; of each month, starting on 12 February 2019. Check out all the dates on our &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;events page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pride&quot;&gt;Pride&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil service volunteers organised many pride groups around the UK last year across departmental and national networks; and we hope to have a strong showing at other pride events this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we plan to take part in all 4 capital prides across the UK: Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London. We’ll also be doing Pride in London a bit differently to ensure that allocations of places are fairer and more evenly distributed across various demographics and groups. More details on this, and all our other prides, will be released in the coming weeks, but we’ve added placeholder dates to our events page in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep up to date with our events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We publish all our events on our website. You can find the events page at &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;civilservice.lgbt/events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/01/15/gsi-email-addresses-are-being-phased-out-update-your-details/">&lt;p&gt;You might be aware that government email addresses that end in &lt;em&gt;.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/em&gt; – sometimes referred to as “GSI” emails – are being phased out and replaced with just &lt;em&gt;gov.uk&lt;/em&gt; email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual departments are making the changes at their own pace, but at some point in the near future email address that end in &lt;em&gt;.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/em&gt; will no longer receive emails. Check with your departmental IT team to see when your emails are changing, and what they are changing to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your email address is changing, and you signed up for our newsletter using your GSI email address, you will need to update your details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-update-your-email-address&quot;&gt;How to update your email address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already registed with your GSI email address, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/update-profile&quot;&gt;update your profile&lt;/a&gt; page and input your existing details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message box will appear below the form (ignore any errors you see). In the message box will be a link that says “Click here to update your profile”. Select that link: it will send you an email with a final link to our mailing list system where you can change your email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn’t work, you can simply &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us&quot;&gt;re-register from scratch&lt;/a&gt; with your new email, and unsubscribe at your old email address. A link to unsubscribe is included at the bottom of every email we send you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-two-sets-of-newsletters-already&quot;&gt;Getting two sets of newsletters already?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re already receiving two newsletters, it’s because you’ve signed up with both your GSI and your non-GSI email address. You can unsubscribe using the links at the bottom of the emails.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<updated>2019-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/01/03/leaders-of-networks-forum/">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network exists to connect LGBT+ civil servants across government and represent their interests. We do that in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by setting up activities and events for individual civil servants who are our members, whether or not they they have an LGBT+ network in their local building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by working with local networks – where they exist – to gather information and act on their feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/&quot;&gt;prior consultation&lt;/a&gt;, we said we wanted to create strong local networks. We are aiming to provide support and assurance to networks, so that every civil servant can access a locally based LGBT+ network wherever they live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also said we wanted “to create a forum where network leaders can collaborate and work together to support one another”. We called it the “Heads of Networks Forum”. &lt;strong&gt;We’re setting it up now, starting this month&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve also changed the name – to the “Leaders of Networks Forum” – in recognition that not every great departmental leader is necessarily the chair of their network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forum is aimed at those helping to lead and run departmental networks; not LGBT+ champions or wider volunteers of local networks. Representatives from all departmental and agency networks are welcome to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose that it meets every 3 months to discuss issues important to network leads, get updates from central Civil Service policy teams, and to work on shared issues. We also think this should be a regular chance for networks to hold the cross-government network to account and to offer help to deliver on shared projects. A terms of reference will be agreed at the first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first meeting of the Leaders of Networks Forum will be on &lt;strong&gt;31 January 2019&lt;/strong&gt; at the Department for Education’s building in central London. Conference calling and Skype video calling will also be available for those who can’t physically make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to attend, you need to register. Please &lt;a href=&quot;/event/2019-01-31-leaders-of-networks-forum/&quot;&gt;contact us via the event page&lt;/a&gt; to let us know you want to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll publish the agenda about a week in advance, and send venue and dial-in details directly to delegates. We hope to see you then!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<updated>2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2019/01/01/year-in-review/">&lt;p&gt;So we’ve all seen off 2018, and welcomed in the new year. 2019 has lots in store for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, building on the wide range of activities we’ve undertaken in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-did&quot;&gt;What we did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/6-prides.png&quot; alt=&quot;6 prides&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve taken part in no fewer than 6 pride events across the length and breadth of the UK. We, of course, took part in Pride in London in July; but civil servants also marched in places like Hastings, Manchester and Leeds (to name but a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national networks also led groups in each of the 3 capital prides outside of London: Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh. This year, we’re aiming to be there again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/30-events.png&quot; alt=&quot;30 events&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hosted around 30 events last year too. Most of these events this year have been social events, and we’re slowly expanding them across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can keep up to date with our 2019 events on our &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;events page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/events.png&quot; alt=&quot;More events in more places&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve held social events in Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Cardiff, and Edinburgh in 2018; and we’ve got plans to do the same again this year. In 2019, thanks to volunteers in Bristol, we will now also have monthly socials for south west civil servants, and we’re working towards the same in the Cardiff and South Wales area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to help? We’re always looking for local organisers to help out; &lt;a href=&quot;/about/our-team/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with others volunteering in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/bispace.png&quot; alt=&quot;BiSpace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by bi civil servants, 2018 saw us launch ‘BiSpace’; a new space for people in the Civil Service who identify as bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer to meet. We launched it with 3 events in Manchester, Bristol and London to mark Bi Visibility Day – and we’ll be holding more events throughout 2019 so that our network is inclusive of bi+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/allies-week.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allies Week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also launched our first national Civil Service Allies Week. For 2018, we invited allies to share what they’re doing locally to be a good ally; and for 2019, we’re planning to make Allies Week bigger and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/50-blog-posts.png&quot; alt=&quot;50 blog posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Allies Week helped us to publish more than 50 blog posts in 2018. We also kept our &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; running and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/cslgbt&quot;&gt;social media feeds&lt;/a&gt; topped up so that you could find out what we were up to, and how you could get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/year-in-review/sue-owen-review.png&quot; alt=&quot;Policy input&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also worked closely with Dame Sue Owen’s LGBT Champion’s group and with Civil Service Employee Policy (CSEP) as part of the Civil Service’s review into bullying and harassment, and worked with the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion team to ensure that the Civil Service was practicing what we preach as part of the Government’s LGBT Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onwards-to-2019&quot;&gt;Onwards to 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a great 2018; and we’re looking forward to 2019. Keep your eyes on our &lt;a href=&quot;/events&quot;&gt;event listings&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you’ve signed up to &lt;a href=&quot;/join-us&quot;&gt;our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to keep up to date with all the latest news and information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/21/bristol-social-roundup/">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday 6th November the first, of what will hopefully be monthly, Civil Service LGBT+ network socials in Bristol took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been nearly 2 years since an organised LGBT+ social took place in our amazing city so we were all excited to get together. Around 25 people joined us from a range of government departments across the city, including Ministry of Defence, Environment Agency and Cabinet Office to enjoy some very casual drinks and food at a pub that offers a discount for Civil Servants – which we were all, of course, delighted at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Dorion and Richard for organising and ensuring that the event was warm and welcoming to everybody under the LGBT+ banner, and for kickstarting what will hopefully be a very active LGBT+ network in the South West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in Bristol or the South West join us for our next monthly social on Wednesday 5th December. You can find the details on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018-12-05-bristol-social/&quot;&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/2409606785735978/&quot;&gt;join our Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for updates and events.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<updated>2018-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/15/world-aids-day-matthew-s-story</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/15/world-aids-day-matthew-s-story/">&lt;p&gt;It’s nearing that time of year: Christmas and religious festivals are approaching. It’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldaidsday.org&quot;&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; next month, and to me it’s a time of sadness and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering friends, friends of friends, and ex-partners who have sadly lost the fight of HIV related illnesses, but also a celebration of the people and how far the treatment and prevention has come in the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, there’s still a huge stigma. Seeing people describe being HIV-negative as “clean” is a real shock; especially on LGBT social networks and dating apps. Within the first messages you get a lot of &lt;em&gt;“are you poz or neg?”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“are you clean?”&lt;/em&gt;. My general reply is &lt;em&gt;“yes, I wash”&lt;/em&gt; or just &lt;em&gt;“my name is Matt”&lt;/em&gt;, which generally ends a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is great to know your status and be responsible for your own actions but a person should not be defined by their blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone around in the 80s will remember the tombstone adverts, and thankfully HIV and AIDS is not the death sentence it was. Great advances are being made and with things like free testing being widely available, &lt;abbr title=&quot;Pre-exposure prophylaxis&quot;&gt;PrEP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;abbr title=&quot;Post-exposure prophylaxis&quot;&gt;PEP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, various combination pills and also just living undetectable. But all these advances cost money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in past jobs, and now this one, I always try to raise money on World AIDS Day by selling red ribbons. You’ll find some of them in many Civil Service offices this week, or on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldaidsday.org/the-red-ribbon&quot;&gt;World AIDS Day website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small thing that makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please paint the town red, or just spare a £1 for a red ribbon if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to fund raise for World AIDS Day, you can order a box of red ribbons for your office from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldaidsday.org/the-red-ribbon&quot;&gt;World AIDS Day website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Pre-exposure prophylaxis&quot;&gt;PrEP&lt;/abbr&gt; is a drug that can be taken to prevent you contracting HIV. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/02/allies-in-action-naomi-diver</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/02/allies-in-action-naomi-diver/">&lt;p&gt;My name is Naomi Diver and have been working for the Environment Agency (EA) for almost 6 years and during that time I’ve moved around different areas and teams. I have always been impressed with how friendly and kind my colleagues are and the great diversity that is championed everywhere you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Freshwater Ecologist based in East Midlands and I am lucky enough to have 3 members of the LGBT+ community in my team, from relatively new starters right through to long standing members of the team. More recently I have become aware that there is more I could have been doing as a straight ally to support them in the work place and raise the profile of the EA as a Stonewall top 100 employer with an amazingly active LGBT+ network. I have been a friend of the network for a while but I came to the realisation that I have been a passive friend, rather than an active one. I decided this had to change…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2018 I took part in Nottingham Pride. I had never attended a Pride event before and was very excited to be part of it but also a little nervous. The weather was beautifully sunny and clear as I walked into town. Meeting together beforehand was great to get to know people from other EA depots and offices who were attending Pride, soon there was a whole gaggle of us (&lt;em&gt;Troop? Gang? Shoal? What is the correct term? Pride seems too on the nose&lt;/em&gt;). I was sporting a very fashionable Environment Agency black polo shirt and hat (&lt;em&gt;I sometimes feel like an ecologist ninja at work decked out in mostly black&lt;/em&gt;) but something was missing – oh that’s right rainbows and glitter! Once the obligatory makeover had occurred I was ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/allies-week-naomi-diver.png&quot; alt=&quot;Naomi and EA colleagues at Pride&quot; title=&quot;Naomi and EA colleagues at Pride&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conglomeration of people at the start line was an amazing celebration; music was playing from a variety of sources mashing together, whistles blaring, flags waving, people dancing and chatting. There was a palpable energy in the air. The variety of organisations present impressed me, and I felt honoured to be representing the EA to so many people in my home town. Our group managed to join forces with the Civil Service representatives and we were off, marching with banners, rainbow umbrellas, and most importantly lots of sweets to hand out along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route was through the centre of town and we ambled our way along, dashing here and there with gay abandon (&lt;em&gt;sorry, I couldn’t resist getting that in&lt;/em&gt;) handing out sweets and smiles. The people lining the streets were young and old, some were there on purpose and others had the luck of stumbling across the parade whilst popping out for some milk or a Greggs pasty. It was honestly one of the most fun things I’ve done in a while and despite having a smile on my face for the entirety of the 2 hour parade my cheeks didn’t even ache. Once completed I felt elated and didn’t want to stop, I could have done it all over again, however we all settled for a trip to the pub instead with the Civil Service reps for a well-deserved pint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend taking part in a Pride event to absolutely &lt;strong&gt;everyone&lt;/strong&gt;! It was only a few hours on a Saturday but I hope it made a difference to my colleagues and friends to feel supported at work and at home. But also to members of the LGBT+ community everywhere that there are lots of employers who celebrate diversity. There is so much you can do as an active ally of the LGBT+ community so please get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-post-script-from-the-environment-agency-lgbt-network&quot;&gt;A post script from the Environment Agency LGBT+ Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Shelley Doe and I am the LGBT+ Network Rep for East Midlands. I could not be more proud of the support the Friends Network has provided in our Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had personal accounts from new starters about the difference it has made to them seeing Friends badges and LGBT+ Network lanyards and the very visible support the Allies provide. They can come into work and know they are able to be themselves without fear of negative feelings and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended Notts Pride and it was &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt;. Another opportunity for me to burst with pride about how great my EA colleagues are and to show this off to the people of Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have 5 Friends Leads in our Area and they provide huge support in helping me organise events. And having other active members such as Naomi around site who are willing to get actively involved makes everything easier and increases visibility even more. It feels more powerful when it is somebody outside of the LGBT+ community who is making a stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all. Your importance should not be underestimated and nor should the impact it can have on those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Civil Service allies Week is a chance to highlight the important role of LGBT+ allies in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/02/allies-in-action-matt-baugh/">&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name’s Matt. I’m a Director in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) and have been an LGBT+ ally for two years. I’m a Board champion and proud supporter of my department’s LGBT+ network, Out and Proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From discussions with LGBT friends and colleagues over the years, I know that ending discrimination and ensuring that all of us can be ourselves at work needs everyone involved: it isn’t a side issue, or something simply for our HR colleagues; it’s an issue for each and everyone of us. Only by working together can we end discrimination at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I believe Allies are hugely important. Allies stand together, through thick and thin. We give each other support, help and guidance when it’s needed most - and sometimes even when it’s not. Being an Ally is about affirming my support, standing up for what I believe in and being visible for my friends and colleagues. They’d do the same for me. That’s an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the law has changed, for many it’s not yet translated into true equality. That’s why we all need to work together. That’s why being an Ally - and having Allies - is so important. Together, we can be catalysts for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Civil Service allies Week is a chance to highlight the important role of LGBT+ allies in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/02/allies-in-action-ian-moore/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Senior Officer at HMP Pentonville.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an LGBT ally for years but I only joined PiPP, the LGBT network in July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it is important to be an ally because I am able too. In my job my colleagues and I greatly rely on each other, sometimes in very dangerous situations. At that point in time I do not care if the person helping me is gay, trans or otherwise so why should it be a problem at other times. Because of this I decided to become an ally as the problems are not always with prisoners but sometimes staff. Being long in service I am known by most staff and I am confident enough to speak up if something needs to be challenged and can therefore be a good ally for any new of less confident staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not matter how brilliant you are as an ally if no-one knows who you are. I have a LGBT notice board which includes my name and where my office is, my desk area is adorned with official LGBT Network posters, I sent (with permission) a global email naming me and telling people how to contact me and/or join the network plus I had a stand at our recent staff wellbeing day.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/01/allies-in-action-sara-daunton/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an RAF Police Officer currently serving as the Officer Commanding Security Flight for the Air Warfare Centre based at RAF Waddington. My job is looking after the day to day security of people, information and assets such as aircraft across the UK and in our 6 permanent locations in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been involved with D&amp;amp;I and the creation of an inclusive workplace for many years but having had the chance to work alongside some of our transgender colleagues here in the AWC, I was inspired by their courage and determination to be true to themselves. I decided to become a formal ally in 2017 and undertook the Stonewall Course. I am also a member of the newly formed RAF LGBT Allies network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still pockets of discrimination or unwillingness to accept those who are different within Defence and an Ally can often open a conversation or challenge perceptions where they hear or see inappropriate behaviour. I also think it’s really important that Allies bridge a gap between the LGBT+ community and those who work with, manage or may need to offer support to the community and to help them understand how they can the best from their people. We are also trying to encourage those serving parents, grandparents, siblings and friends who may be struggling with a loved one coming out as Gay or Trans to seek support for themselves in the family journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My email signature block has the proud to an ally slogan and logo embedded into it so every time I send an email, I send the Ally message and I send a lot of emails both internally and internationality; I’m really proud that Defence supports me in sending this message. I wear my Ally badge on my Lanyard and am a member of the local RAF LGBT+ Freedom Network and I marched with the first ever Military Contingent to take place in Lincoln Pride this year.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/11/01/allies-in-action-paul-wilson/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job role is currently ‘Head of Technical Services’ within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation; I lead a team of dedicated deep subject matter experts in a wide and diverse portfolio of disciplines from Engineering; Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Fire, Building Standards. Occupational Safety and Wellbeing. Environmental Protection; Environmental Planning, Ecology, Forestry, Historic Estate and Scheduled Monuments, Sustainability. And Security; Electronic Security Systems, Access Control, CCTV and Physical Security (Barriers and Fencing) and Security Furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been the DIO LGBT Network Champion for about 18 months, but consider I have been an informal ally for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really important to have LGBT+ allies, both in the workplace and society, for their active and visible support to individuals, colleagues and events to help break down any misplaced stereotyping, barriers or indeed discrimination towards individuals or groups, and to challenge inappropriate behaviours when they occur.  As a Champion it is also vital in providing senior support to colleagues who may be experiencing discrimination or be subject to inappropriate behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actively support Cross Government, MOD and DIO LGBT+ events; and indeed, Diversity and Inclusion events in the round.  For example, this year I have participated / attended the DIO D&amp;amp;I ‘Lived Experience’ event; the sh…OUT Annual Conference in London; the recent DWP run ‘OneTeamGov LGBT+’ event in Manchester; along with many other local events.  I am a member of the DIO SCS Reverse Mentoring Programme, and finally, I am also an active member of the DIO D&amp;amp;I Steering Group and LGBT+ Network (as Champion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job role is DWP ‘Taskforce’ team leader in Pembroke Dock Service Centre for Wales and Southern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well really all my teen and adult life, but more as an activist in the workplace since getting involved in Wales Inclusion Diversity Equality Network (WIDEN) and subsequently DWPride (DWP’s LGBT+ network) in 2017/2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel everyone should have a voice no matter who they are and we should all be treated equally by meeting individual needs. Giving a voice to someone matters and particularly in the workplace as we spend so much time in the working environment we should be able to be who we want to be without fear or prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have delivered a presentation to the office promoting Inclusion and Diversity and developed visual identity of WIDEN Ambassadors so staff can be assured whom they can turn to for support if needed. I have developed a display including all staff on site creating Inclusivity through an Inclusive tree. I focussed on Gender Reassignment during Inclusion week delivering a communication to all staff to raise awareness of what is transgender and gender reassignment also how to engage with transgender customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the Chief Digital &amp;amp; Information Officer at the Ministry of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an LGBT+ ally since I joined the MoJ around two years ago. Before then, I was not familiar with the role of an “ally”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a straight, white, cis man, being an ally means someone who will stand up and support and celebrate the rights of LGBTQI people in our workplace, and right across society. More than that though: it is about celebrating difference, of shining a light on the many benefits to our culture we get from having a thriving LGBTQI community. Allies are important because so often equality is thought to be the problem of the minority, not the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweet and blog about LGBT+ issues, and about diversity and inclusion more widely. I regularly attend our LGBT+ social outings (aka the “rainbow raves”) to show my support. I feel that it is important for me, as a Director, to be noisy about LGBT+ issues so people know that it is safe for them to be themselves in our workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an Employment Support Allowance Decision Maker for The Department for Work and Pensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an LGBT+ ally for 30+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to be an ally both in and out of the workplace but as we spend most of our time in work, people should not have to hide who they are or pretend to be something they are not for fear of ridicule or judgement.  I feel it is important to get to know someone’s story, get to know people for &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; they are not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are. I think you can only be your best when you’re being yourself and your sexual orientation or gender identity should never be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Bullying, Harassment and Discrimination (BHD) officer and I am very aware of LGBTQ+ rights as part of my role.  I will always call out inappropriate behaviour or language and have found that people are unaware what they are saying could be deemed offensive. It is important to remember, “banter” is not always harmless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for HMCTS in Cwmbran as a contact centre operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined as an ally late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to be an ally as the need to be able to support against adverse opinions and to also to be able to assist somebody to be comfortable in their own skin, to be who they really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have asked the trainers to advise all the new starters that I am available as an ally if they need a friendly ear or any support, and have also informed the current staff.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/31/allies-in-action-nick-pett/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a civil servant in the Ministry of Defence and I am currently working on a short-term project looking at our Head Office and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that I know – but I suppose it would be fair to say I have thought of my activity in that way much more in the last couple of years, in particular since we started formalising ally roles, for example through Stonewall’s training package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an ally I am responsible for educating myself and taking that knowledge into spaces where LGBT+ people are under-represented (or not represented at all) and where the issues facing LGBT+ people are not understood/not considered.  I am responsible for spotting and understanding ignorance, prejudice and phobic behaviour in the workplace, and addressing it.  I make myself available – and publicise that availability for example through our internal LGBT+ networks – to people to come and talk about their experiences.  And it is my responsibility as an ally to make a particular effort to support LGBT+ people, to help address the imbalances in our workforce and culture, and the structural/systemic barriers that exist, by helping them to achieve their potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems that we are trying to solve on behalf of the taxpayer are too complex to address without change: if we are to have a hope of being successful we need to be more diverse in our workforce and more inclusive in our workplaces.  Without being able to recruit and retain the very best workforce from the population we will lack the skills, experience and perspectives that will help us to develop innovative and lasting solutions.  LGBT+ people need to know that they can be themselves in government, that they will be supported and developed to achieve their potential, that this is not a tolerant or neutral working environment but one of welcome and celebration.  That is something that I strive to show as an ally, both within the department and outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I attended the Royal College of Defence Studies – studying international relations, leadership and strategy with military and civilian colleagues from across the world.  While there I focused on regularly raising questions in lectures and seminars around the particular impacts of conflict and global issues on LGBT+ people and their rights.  I learnt about queer theory alongside my main course studies and shared that learning with colleagues.  I organised a course trip to Flare – the British Film Institute’s LGBT+ Film Festival – and helped to organise publicity for Pride Month in the College. In May I visited Eastern Europe to understand more about that region; while there I attended the launch of Moldova Pride alongside Her Majesty’s Ambassador Lucy Joyce, and I organised opportunities for our visiting group to meet LGBT+ advocates and activists in Moldova and Romania. Having returned to the Ministry of Defence I am looking forward to acting in support of our new LGBT+ Champion, attending LGBT+ events as a delegate and a speaker, and continuing to learn as much as I can about queer history and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/31/allies-in-action-jacky-lawrence/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am PA to Resident Judge Martin in the Asylum &amp;amp; Immigration Tribunal in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an LGBT Ally for about 18 years; as long as I have been a civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people could do with a friendly face at work.  Some people could do with it more than others. So, that’s me; The Friendly Face. My Uncle Charlie, who died many years ago, was a gay man back when it was illegal. My family, his brothers and sisters and our extended family, all loved Uncle Charlie. He was always welcome in our homes and he made the trip by train from Brighton to London several times a year.  He was a hot favourite at Christmas. Always up for a sing along and a couple of rounds of the Conga…. Up the stairs, into the bathroom, down the stairs, out of the front door, down the street, around the lamppost, back up the street and back in through the front door. You probably would have had to born in the 50s/60s to know what the Conga is. If it’s new to you – learn the ‘song’ and have a go!  Be careful if you end up at the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the importance of an Ally is, to others, many different things but to me it is inclusivity. Not just at work but everywhere. Everyone should feel welcome and included.  Everyone should be treated with respect. Don’t just say the words, do the actions.  Smile, say hi, be interested. Don’t waste energy being mean.  Use your energy wisely.  It costs nothing to be nice, understanding, welcoming. Lead by example.  I’m not perfect but I would rather be an imperfect friend than a perfect stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having allies at work can empower and strengthen us, give us the courage or support we need to get through the next hour, day, week. Help us to overcome hurdles, find solutions and resolutions, and to help us to understand that even when a resolution is slow to come there is always someone on our side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been in the same office for the last 16/17 years.  I was a Rainbow Network Rep, alongside my friend Peter, for all of that time.  We went to network sessions, we had a noticeboard (which we still use) and we attended induction sessions for new staff to introduce the Rainbow Network. The noticeboard is now used to put up newspaper&amp;amp; magazine articles. We focus on the good news and useful info for the noticeboard.  When the Network was ‘disbanded’ we set up our After-Hours club. We meet every other month, everyone is welcome, for a meal out. I have a Garden Party every year and we have away days too.  We have people from different offices and everyone is welcome to bring a friend. We have worked at inclusivity here in Manchester and we are fortunate to have some great colleagues who show by their actions that they are allies without even thinking that they are! Those are the best allies you can have.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/30/allies-in-action-sam-forster/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 18 months I have been working in the prison education policy team in the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), and leading specifically on assessment and accountability policy – though in reality, the majority of that time has been spent working on the procurement of new prison education contracts, which will roll out from April next year, and have provided prison governors with the fantastic opportunity to design and commission the education services that best suit the needs of their individual prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became an ally a few years ago whilst working at the Department for Education. One of my team members at the time asked if I would consider it – and I must confess that it wasn’t something I’d considered, or even given much thought to, before – and when she explained more about the role that allies play I was more than happy to become one! When I moved to the MOJ I continued to be an ally – it is something that I’ll do for the remainder of my career (a long time still!), and the great thing is that it doesn’t rely upon there being a formal network or similar, it is simply something you can take into any role with you, it’s a way of being!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to be an ally for both personal and professional reasons. I am lucky, I have always felt able to be myself and feel comfortable at work and in my personal life – the thought that anyone might be in a different position doesn’t sit well with me - everybody should feel able to be themselves in any situation, without fear of the reactions of others. The role of an ally should help to promote that message and develop more inclusive environments within which individuals feel able to be themselves. In a professional sense, having allies in the office is extremely important as well, it sends a message that inclusivity is a shared responsibility and not something that is owned by any particular group – we all have a duty to ensure our workplace is a safe and welcoming place where everyone can be comfortable, regardless of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key things I’ve realised and tried to address as an ally is that unless you are part of an LGBT+ network, you often won’t see or hear many important and interesting messages relating to the community. I’ve therefore always tried to help disseminate messages more widely – generally by talking to the director’s office and asking them to send key messages out to the group via email. Another big part of the role of an ally, as I see it, is making yourself available (and ensuring people know it!) to listen to and support any colleagues who may want to talk about LGBT+ issues. This is as easy as sending an email, something I’ll try to do a few times a year so that people are aware. Another simple way to promote both the role and your own availability is to add something to your email signature. I also encourage others to get involved and raise awareness of how they can support the LGBT+ community – such as signing Stonewall’s ‘No Bystanders’ pledge, committing to never being a bystander to hateful language and abuse. Going forwards, I’m looking forward to working with our network chair to develop some internal information and support for allies and encouraging more people to step up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DWP Personal Independence Payment Disputes Resolution Team Case Manager at Newport, Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an ally for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that there is still a lack of understanding about the struggles faced by people in the LGBTQ+ community. I think it’s important for them to have people to support them and help spread awareness and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wear my rainbow lanyard. I attended the PRIDE event in Cardiff. I am waiting for a meeting with senior leadership to discuss ways to raise awareness and I discuss it within my team on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/30/allies-in-action-isobel-lowe-zinola/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job title is Performance, Risk and Resourcing Committee Secretariat, but more broadly I work in Central Governance for the Department for Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have considered myself an Ally since I was a teenager, I became more conscious of my allyship during my time as Women’s Officer for my college at University, and as a committee member for Cambridge University Amnesty International. In both of these roles, an awareness of LGBT+ issues and involvement in those causes was essential. More recently, when I joined the Civil Service in July 2018 I signed up to be a departmental ally immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for LGBT+ people and their rights should be active rather than passive. I think people in the Civil Service generally consider themselves very liberal, but active engagement is really essential. I believe, as allies, we need to proudly voice our support for our LGBT+ colleagues, acknowledge the issues they continue to face at work and in the wider world, and work to address these, because that’s the only way to achieve real change.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being in post, I have helped to organise Stonewall Allies training for DfE colleagues (scheduled for Nov 18), and analysed data of our current allies to think about ways to tailor initiatives and events to interest and include allies. I am putting myself forward for election to the new ‘Allies Officer’ role in the DfE and have received training to help deliver LGBT+ awareness sessions to DfE colleagues. Aside from that, I wear my LGBT+ rainbow lanyard with pride, and try to always listen to my LGBT+ colleagues to learn how I can be of most use to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the Provost Marshal (Army) and Commander of 1st Military Police Bde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially for about a year, but I consider I have been an ally all my life. I have been particularly active in promoting LGBT+ matters across the Royal Military Police since 2007 when I attended the first Army LGBT Forum, the year before uniform was first worn at PRIDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more important than just being in the office. It is really important that senior leaders are identifiable as allies: in the office, on exercise or on operations. Through active promotion across our social media outlets, the setting of aggressive targets for my commanders and a ‘constant conversation’ of diversity matters across the regular, reserve and retired communities this is something that I try to build into the muscle memory of the organisation. I am hugely lucky that we have no problem recruiting talent into the Royal Military Police but we want to continue bringing in the best, removing barriers and making sure that the many external agencies that we work alongside recognise us as a forward-thinking, employer of choice which values diversity and maximise talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Civil Service Allies Week is a chance to highlight the important role of LGBT+ allies in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/30/allies-in-action-caroline-hendrix/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a Marketing Campaign Manager USA for the Department for International Trade (DIT), based in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my life! But for DIT, since our DIT allies program started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for LGBT+ causes shouldn’t just come from within the community. I’ve lived in NYC for 15 years and worked in the theatre community for 8 so I have loads of friends in the gay community and couldn’t imagine not supporting causes that matter to the people I’m close to. Equality and equal human rights is just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation in Pride is one of my favourite things we do each year and I’ll never forget the experience of marching in NYC Pride two days after the US Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage in 2015. We marched 150 strong and I’ve never experienced anything as joyful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been instrumental in organizing Pride for the Americas region since 2013. In my former role as the FCO events lead for New York, I organized Consulate participation in NYC Pride for three years. I then switched over to the DIT North America marketing team, where I’ve been the Love is GREAT marketing lead for another three years. Working across DIT, FCO, Visit Britain &amp;amp; British Council, the project has continued to grow and this year with the continued financial support of the GREAT Challenge Fund, we participated in Pride in 27 cities across 6 countries including the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile &amp;amp; Uruguay! 
I’m very proud of this work especially since it’s for something I believe in strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a superficial level, I have rainbow Union Jack fans hanging out on my desk and I wear my rainbow lanyard every day!&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/29/allies-week/">&lt;p&gt;This week is Civil Service Allies Week. From 29 October to 2 November, we’ll be recognising the important role of allies in making our workplaces more diverse and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LGBT+ people, we are in a very small minority. That’s also true in the Civil Service. Based on responses to the Civil Service People Survey, we estimate up to 20,000 civil servants are lesbian, gay, bisexual or ‘other’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We see and hear about LGBT+ civil servants doing fantastic work to make things better for people like them at work every day, but we also know that they couldn’t do all of that without support from people who don’t identify as LGBT+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve set up Allies week, to thank those doing their part and to encourage more colleagues to step up and be active allies in their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;civil-service-allies-week-posts&quot;&gt;Civil Service Allies Week posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be posting new blog posts and resources all week. Keep checking this page for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the Squadron Quarter Master Sargent (SQMS) for 63 Works Group Royal Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an ally for about 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important to be an ally because even with society moving towards a non-prejudice climate, there are still barriers to individuals feeling accepted and comfortable being who they are.  Allies are just one way to demonstrate an organisations commitment to creating an environment free from discrimination, and also to promote diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have ‘Ally’ on my signature block and I distribute the monthly newsletter across my work place. I also have notice boards displaying posters, information, newsletters along with the Army’s Diversity policy and my information as the lead Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Officer for my work place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the Defence Cyber Protection Partnership Communications Manager, working in the Ministry of Defence (MOD). I have been in post since November 2017. I’ve recently completed my 19th year in the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became an ally about two and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an ally is important because it sets the tone in the workplace environment to be one that encourages and values input. It welcomes people in, so a person isn’t fearful about who they are. I also think places that are ‘people positive’ are the best ones to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a signature block and include it in bios particularly when presenting to industry audiences. I’ve spoken at three MOD Ally events, written an intranet blog, marched in Pride 2017, and helped organise a government-wide briefing on sexuality, mental health and vetting. On top of that, I’ve organised LGBT networking lunches, contributed to Mission Critical and arranged two Stonewall Ally training sessions. I’m also setting up work to produce a leaflet so people do not self-exclude from jobs requiring security clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as an engagement and employee lifecycle expert and race ambassador in the Ministry of Justice’s People Group. I’ve been in this post for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been an LGBT+ ally since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies are important as they can help people who are not intrinsic owners of the issues to see what life is like in someone else’s shoes. It’s important to have people who will act as advocates; to ensure that everybody is able to bring their whole, authentic self, to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wear a rainbow pin on my lanyard at work and have built into the work I have been doing on black history month the importance of intersectionality. I am also planning to include some events during LGBT History Month in Feb 2019 outside of work as a Deputy County Commissioner for People and Culture Change in Scouting in London I enable LGBT+ leaders to feel supported in their scouting roles&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/29/allies-in-action-elaine-radburn/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-job-role-and-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;What’s your job role and where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a strategic communications manager in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-have-you-been-an-ally&quot;&gt;How long have you been an ally?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an ally since April 2016, when I attended some Stonewall ally training and helped to set up our Ally Network here in MHCLG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-think-its-important-to-be-an-ally-and-to-have-allies-within-an-office&quot;&gt;Why do you think it’s important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ally has a really important role in helping to create a workplace where everyone can bring their true self to work, whether they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex or asexual (LGBT+). You only have to read the latest research which highlights the shocking levels of hate crime and discrimination that LGBT+ people still face in Britain today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a great place to work makes good business sense too.  Happy people are more productive. Fact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-you-done-to-be-a-visible-ally-within-your-office-or-what-do-you-plan-to-do&quot;&gt;What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the purely practical, it can be tricky to stand out in a crowd and when you don’t work at a fixed desk so we wear LGBT+ ally lanyards here in MHCLG so we can be easily identified. I also set up an intranet page with details and contacts on our ally network. Another very useful thing to do is to include something about your networks in your staff welcome packs and on your staff induction session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a super close working relationship with our LGBT network chair which I think contributes to our success and progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to blog regularly - It was National Hate Crime Awareness Week a few weeks ago, so I wrote about hate crime and the LGBT+ community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of my proudest achievements to date is when we recently launched our transitioning at work policy, rather than just publish it on our intranet I invited in a friend, who is transitioning, to talk about her personal experiences to our SCS at their weekly Round Up with our Permanent Secretary. It was a very moving experience for all in the room and afterwards people said how impactful the session had been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then more generally I keep a keen eye out for new allies. We have lots more planned and these days we tend to be less tactical and more strategic about how we go about things.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/28/stonewall-workplace-equality-index-whats-next/">&lt;p&gt;Whilst many of you have just submitted your WEI and thought you had seen the last of it for this year, I’m afraid we’ve come to disrupt that. But don’t fear - we are here to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a group of four, from around the civil service, working with the Civil Service LGBT+ network in helping departments improve their position in the index. We want to create a culture across the networks where good practice is shared, and we all work collaboratively together in helping one another to improve the quality of their departments’ LGBT+ guidance, practices and policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed within the index submissions there are sections that are outside of your department’s control, such as procurement. Therefore, it makes sense that we all work together to provide a stronger case, to both improve our procurement procedures and standardise how we respond within the index. Not only will this help reduce work load when filling in the index, but it is also a way to hold Stonewall to account, in making sure their marks are consistent across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working towards producing a document ready for Spring 2019 that will help in all of this, but before we can get to that stage we need help from you. Over the next coming weeks we will be reaching out to department LGBT+ networks and/or D&amp;amp;I teams to talk about the WEI. We would be grateful to talk to you about your submission, your previous index rating and what your network and department does well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will all help shape the guidance we will produce, and most of all, we hope it will help you. Surely the best way to learn and improve is from one another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this guidance won’t be perfect after one year, it can constantly be reviewed and adapted to continue to help you in your submissions. Whilst we understand the WEI has its competitive side, we are all at the end of the day, one civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working with you, to not only help with the index, but to help improve and enhance your networks and LGBT+ policy. We feel this will also help to improve the quality of our workplace life as LGBT+ civil servants. Please feel free to get in contact with us now if you would like to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/24/what-happened-at-one-team-gov/">&lt;p&gt;On 11 October 2018 I attended the “OneTeamGov LGBT*” event in Manchester. One of the organisers, Rachel Poole, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2018/10/04/one-team-gov-lgbt-conference&quot;&gt;wrote about the event&lt;/a&gt; and why it was taking place, earlier this month. I was pleased that this event took place in my home town as most Civil Service LGBT events are held in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing best practice and creating an inclusive environment for all LGBT+ colleagues and customers were the themes for the day. Speakers from different departments of the civil service shared their experiences of implementing and promoting LGBT+ equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of workshops took place. These included discussions on the importance of networking and investigating the barriers to coming out at work. My favourite contribution of the day was hearing an inspirational manager share her experience of supporting a transgender colleague within her team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was filled with laughter, tears and the opportunity to interact with other LGBT+ members of the Civil Service. I came away with new ideas, new contacts, and most of all with a feeling of pride that there are many others who share the same views and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a brilliant and well organised day.  I look forward to the next one, and hope it will take place at this end of the M6.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/24/interview-rachel-poole-oneteamgov-lgbt/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Civil Service LGBT staff and allies gathered in Manchester for “OneTeamGov LGBT”. Many of our volunteers attended, and one of them, Roisin Murray, caught up with one of the organisers, Rachel Poole, after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roisin:&lt;/em&gt; Congratulations on a organising this event Rachel. How do you feel it went?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I was blown away by last week’s OneTeamGov LGBT*. Bringing together a group of people, who are in many cases used to being discriminated against, for a large scale government conference, to share best practice and practical actions, providing a space where they were valued and accepted was a privilege. I feel it was a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around at the packed room at one point and thought, I made this happen – but while it was my idea it was all the people who said ‘yes’ to me when I was planning it, the support of the OneTeamGov people and the amazing DWP Digital events team that actually made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roisin:&lt;/em&gt; Did it all go to plan?  Did it go as well as you imagined it would?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The event was a huge team effort, and because of that it didn’t just go to plan, it exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the buzz and positivity in the room, the openness of the attendees for sharing personal stories and opinion, the thought-provoking discussions and the appetite to keep the momentum going - to the attention to detail like ensuring a safe space: gender neutral toilets, passes with space for preferred pronouns. And the small thoughtful touches, the Rainbow of Reflection and of course who could resist the rainbow bagels at lunch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roisin:&lt;/em&gt; And how you think the event will grow/change in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; When I first had the idea to bring together the community, I’d not really thought much further than that. That in itself was a huge challenge: would people turn up, would we get a good mix from across government, would people want to join the discussions, would I be able to get people willing to present?
Luckily the answer to all those questions was yes.
If we do it again - I don’t think it needs to change much, being able to provide a space for the x-gov community to get together, discuss and share best practice and practical actions is reason enough. The feedback I’ve had back has been overwhelmingly positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s do it again, let’s have more representation from across government – hopefully those that didn’t make it will make it next time. Let’s have more allies in the room, but still ensure that we have enough space for our champions who will drive forward this agenda. But most importantly, let’s do it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roisin:&lt;/em&gt; Thanks Rachel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It’s a chance to celebrate people who are born intersex, and to highlight the issues they face in their every day lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we’re teaming up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agender.org.uk&quot;&gt;a:gender&lt;/a&gt; and hosting a Twitter chat to mark the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-twitter-chat&quot;&gt;What is a Twitter chat?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Twitter chat is where a group of Twitter users log on at a chosen time to tweet and discuss a certain topic. We’ll be using the hashtag &lt;strong&gt;#CSIAD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll post a series of questions – labelled Q1, Q2, and so on – and you send back your thoughts and comments as answers – using A1, A2, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-take-part&quot;&gt;How can I take part?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be hosting the chat on our Twitter page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cslgbt&quot;&gt;@cslgbt&lt;/a&gt;, between 6:00pm and 7:00pm on Intersex Awareness Day, 26 October 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just log on to Twitter and reply to our #CSIAD tweets – it’s that simple!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<published>2018-10-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2018-10-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/17/we-re-creating-a-civil-service-allies-week</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/17/we-re-creating-a-civil-service-allies-week/">&lt;p&gt;The best estimates we have show that LGBT+ people make up at least 2.5% of the population&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As LGBT+ people, we are in a very small minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s also true in the Civil Service. Based on responses to the Civil Service People Survey, we estimate up to 20,000 civil servants are lesbian, gay, bisexual or ‘other’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We see and hear about LGBT+ civil servants doing fantastic work to make things better for people like them at work every day, but we also know that they couldn’t do all of that without support from people who don’t identify as LGBT+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-need-an-allies-week&quot;&gt;Why we need an Allies Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to recognise the important role of allies in making our workplaces more diverse and inclusive.&lt;/strong&gt; We also want to encourage more colleagues to step up and be active allies in their organisations. So we’re creating an Allies Week to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know allies are going above and beyond to make sure their colleagues feel safe to be themselves at work. We have LGBT+ champions in almost every department, and active ally networks in some too. We want to highlight what they’re doing, in part just to say “thanks!” and ask them to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know some people want to help, but they don’t know where to start. We want to demonstrate what good, active allies do. We want to make sure that saying you’re an ally is more than just wearing a rainbow lanyard and showing up to a Pride event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Allies Week will be for: to champion those doing lots already, and to ask others to get on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allies-week-is-coming-soon&quot;&gt;Allies Week is coming soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re hoping to hold our first Allies Week in the week from 29 October to 2 November 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make Allies Week an annual event. This year we’re going to start small, and next year we’re hoping to have a full range of activities across the UK. Keep checking our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/cslgbt&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/civilservicelgbt&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for everything we’re doing during Allies week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get involved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’re an ally, and you want to get involved in Allies Week; &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether you want to write a blog, share a video, or run an event, we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Data from the Office of National Statistics suggests that around 2.5% of the UK population identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual; the overall LGBT+ population is very likely higher. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The People Survey included gender identity monitoring for the first time in 2017, but as this was an experimental question it doesn’t provide a good basis to make a wider estimate at the moment. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The film, “In Conversation with PRISM” shows network members sharing their views on why being visible in the Civil Service and having allies and role models is important and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iris Outreach is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irisprize.org/&quot;&gt;Iris Prize&lt;/a&gt; family which celebrates excellence in storytelling by showcasing a selection of LGBT content from all over the world. The Iris Outreach project is funded by the Big Lottery Fund to undertake a series of new and exciting projects. Each project will take place across Wales to promote equality and diversity alongside community cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;p&gt;Jack Stephens works for the Welsh Government. Jack volunteers for both the Welsh Government LGBT+ network, Prism, and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coming out wasn’t exactly how I had planned it. I was sure that there would be an explosive atmosphere, long pauses, tears and maybe some tense background music? Fortunately, my family are not the Kardashians, so no drama ensued. This being said, although my family are very understanding – believe me, I am too aware of how lucky I am of this – it didn’t take away from the time I spent worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was worried that my sexuality would become an extension of who I am, I thought that I would be viewed differently – this was something I didn’t want. I think sometimes amongst all the worry, you allow your imagination to travel to places, although deep down you know wouldn’t happen, such as abandonment from family, becoming an outcast. As mentioned previously, I was extremely lucky not to experience this – but at the same time it does happen. I came out at 14 years old, I was greeted with nothing but warmth and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to be able to come out and be your true, authentic, unapologetic self. But you need to come out on your own terms. I often found that telling friends first was a great help and it’s unbelievable the confidence you can adhere from this. Coming out to all was one of the best things I did, although I may have not got the Kardashian-esque drama I was hoping for, I am extremely happy to be myself, an out, confident gay man.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/10/04/bringing-the-cross-government-lgbt-community-together-with-oneteamgov/">&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the Civil Service is our diversity and inclusion (D&amp;amp;I) policies. As the largest government department the DWP is committed to bringing about real change in the D&amp;amp;I space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m Rachel, DWPride’s Communications Lead. DWPride is the LGBT* network for DWP colleagues, it’s a voluntary role – one that I took on because I strongly believe that we should be able to work in an environment that’s inclusive to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day job is on the DWP Digital Talent Marketing Team, where I’m a content writer promoting our organisation as a great place to work. And, being a D&amp;amp;I champion, I want to help create an inclusive environment for LGBT* colleagues and our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oneteamgov-partnership&quot;&gt;OneTeamGov partnership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having followed the social media buzz about OneTeamGov, I thought that our objectives were a great fit with their principles. I connected with some of the organisers, as it seemed like the perfect platform for a cross-government event. Luckily the OneTeamGov community agreed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-event-for-the-lgbt-community&quot;&gt;An event for the LGBT* community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with my DWPride network colleagues I’m helping to bring together a team of volunteers to shape, what is set to be, a valuable event in Manchester on 11 October to coincide with National Coming Out day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes for the day are around sharing best practice and practical actions. We’ve got an amazing line up of speakers and interactive break-out sessions planned, bringing together a range of colleagues from LGBT* networks across the Civil Service, government and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will take place on National Coming Out Day so this will be a fantastic opportunity to show our solidarity, make pledges and spread our message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-inclusive-environment-for-lgbt-champions&quot;&gt;An inclusive environment for LGBT* champions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working closely with other Civil Service departments as well as charities like Stonewall to share best practice and learn from each other. The LGBT* agenda doesn’t sit in isolation, so it’s important that we consider important D&amp;amp;I topics such as intersectionality, understanding policies and creating allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming to raise awareness and education levels of LGBT* issues to help us to be ‘one Civil Service’ working through the challenges together. But it’s not only about that, it’s about camaraderie and providing the champions and leads across government with the opportunity to network, collaborate and help one another in their role as an LGBT* champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about forming new relationships so that we can pick up the phone to our counterpart in another department for help and advice, and it’s about making things better in the future. By bringing together the champions and leads from across government we can build on our commitment to make a difference and move towards our goal of becoming the UK’s most inclusive employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-us&quot;&gt;Join us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an LGBT* champion in government and would be interested in coming along, we still have a few spaces remaining so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/one-team-gov-lgbt-tickets-47708592685&quot;&gt;register for a place now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/09/30/local-organisers/">&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is a nation-wide network. We’ve got members in every part of the UK. We’re entirely reliant on you — our members — to help us do our work around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-local-organisers&quot;&gt;Introducing local organisers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, we’ve been asking for people to come forward and be a “local organiser”. Local organisers are LGBT+ civil servants or allies that want to do things near where they live or work to improve things for LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask our local organisers to do things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;run events in their office focussed on LGBT+ issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;host social or networking events for staff in their area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help to deliver campaigns or themed work that is happening elsewhere in their own area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whos-organising-things-near-me&quot;&gt;Who’s organising things near me?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had lots of people come forward saying they’d like to help out. We’ve started to make a list of them on &lt;a href=&quot;/about/our-team/&quot;&gt;our team page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be regularly publishing any activities that this team of volunteers is planning. You’ll be able to see them on &lt;a href=&quot;/events/&quot;&gt;our events page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you live or work near to one of our local organisers, and you’d like to help them organise something — or if you have an idea for an event of your own — email them or &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; and we can put you in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-there-nothing-near-me&quot;&gt;Why is there nothing near me?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering why an event or activity isn’t taking place near where you live, it’s because we don’t have anyone who’s told us they’d like to help out. If you’d like to step forward, then &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/09/30/getting-the-team-together/">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we published &lt;a href=&quot;/https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;our business plan&lt;/a&gt; and we asked for volunteers from across the Civil Service to help us deliver it. Thanks to everyone who’s come forward so far to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve busy contacting everyone who said they’d like to get involved, figuring out what they’re interested in, and putting them into teams. We wanted to tell you a bit about them and what they’re going to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-teams-were-setting-up&quot;&gt;The teams we’re setting up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re setting up the following teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a team to help us to help with our communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a team to help with our boards, rules and decision making&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams in each part of the UK, made up of local organisers and social coordinators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a set of teams to help us deliver some specific projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post tells you about our new the project teams. If you’d like to get involved in these teams – or with any of our other work – then &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;get in touch with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-project-teams&quot;&gt;The project teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allies&quot;&gt;Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know allies are an important part of creating inclusive workplaces. We’ve set up a team to think about how to build a network of allies across the Civil Service, and how to get them focused on helping with things LGBT+ staff need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know yet whether this will be about creating a national network of volunteers, or about helping departments build their own: the team are looking into what might be most useful first before they go on to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best sources of information that departments get about the experiences of their staff is from the Civil Service People Survey. Each year, the Cabinet Office analyses the results by sexual orientation for each department. Soon, they’re going to start producing gender identity breakdowns so we understand the experiences of transgender staff better too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the People Survey results themselves are challenging to interpret; and we know many people struggle with them. We’re asking this team to make some sense of the People Survey, so that networks can use them as a more effective influencing tool inside their departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bi-inclusion&quot;&gt;Bi inclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, one of our volunteers – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/maryrpeart/&quot;&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; – ran a consultation on the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, queer and asexual staff in the Civil Service. Now we’ve set up a team to implement the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;recommendations from the consultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;campaigns&quot;&gt;Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure all parts of the LGBT+ communities are visible. We’ve set up a team of volunteers to scope out what we’re calling “campaigns” to help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve asked this team to create toolkits that are usable in any Civil Service office in the country, so that anyone, anywhere, can run an event, put a spotlight on an issue, or highlight an important day in the LGBT+ calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inclusive-policy-and-workplace-equality-index-team&quot;&gt;Inclusive Policy and Workplace Equality Index team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important way that departments use to measure how inclusive they are for LGBT+ staff is the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index. Many departments enter the Index, with varying degrees of success. We know departments find it time consuming to enter the Index, and that they get frustrated when the things that all Civil Service organisations do the same get given different scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to fix this, we’ve asked the team to look at what policies and processes exist that are common across departments. If those policies are already inclusive, they’re going to work with the Civil Service team responsible to create model, baseline answers to questions in the Index. If the policies aren’t inclusive, they’ll work to make them inclusive and then develop those model answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get this right, we can reduce the amount of time networks need to spend filling in the Index about things they don’t control, and focus more on the things they can and that are unique to them. It’ll also help us start to tackle the long tail of issues that exist across the Civil Service, even for those who don’t enter the Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentoring&quot;&gt;Mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years there has been a consistent ask for a mentoring scheme run by our network. We know there are a lot of mentoring opportunities in the Civil Service, so we want to make sure that anything we do complements, rather than duplicates that. Before they start establishing a scheme, the team will be going out and asking what you might want from a mentoring scheme. They’ll be asking things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are people looking for a senior LGBT+ role model?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are they looking for senior mentor, but someone who specifically wants to mentor an LGBT+ person?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are they looking for a reverse mentor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for more on this in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had lots of people come forward so far to help: but many hands make light work, and we’re always looking out for people who want to lend a hand. If you’d like to take part in any of these teams, please &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll link you up with the right team.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/09/03/join-us-at-bispace/">&lt;p&gt;Last year, as the bi rep for the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance, I ran a consultation to understand the experiences of bisexual, pansexual, queer and asexual civil servants. I particularly wanted to understand why the Civil Service People Survey results showed that staff who identify as bisexual or with anothe minority sexual orientation, as having lower engagement and wellbeing than their gay, lesbian and heterosexual peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2018, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/&quot;&gt;the results from that consultation&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this, we committed to a range of activities to support the staff who identify as bi, pan, queer or asexual, set out in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt;. One of those was to “create a new community space for bisexual civil servants”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with other bi people across the Civil Service to create “BiSpace”: a new initiative that’s been designed for and by civil servants that are part of the bisexual umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-bispace-is-for&quot;&gt;What BiSpace is for&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BiSpace is a chance for bi civil servants to meet in a safe space and share their experiences. Each BiSpace is organised by civil servants that identify as bi, pan, queer or asexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These events will be informal and sometimes facilitiated; a chance for you to meet other bisexual civil servants, and talk to other people like you. They can be anything you want them to be - you said you wanted a community space, and this is your chance to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bispace-is-starting-this-month&quot;&gt;BiSpace is starting this month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re launching BiSpace to coincide with Bi Visibility Day this September. Volunteers from around government will be holding 3 events: in London and Bristol on 20 September, and in Manchester on 24 September. Bring along your lunch and join us. I look forward to meeting you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can sign up for each of these events on Eventbrite.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;20 September at 12:30 to 14:00 at Horizon House, Bristol.
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/09/20/bispace-bristol/&quot;&gt;Sign up for the Bristol event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;20 September at 12:30 to 14:00 at the BEIS Conference Centre, London.

  &lt;p&gt;24 September at 12:30 to 14:00 at Picadilly Gate, Manchester.

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/31/were-looking-for-volunteers/">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt; is run entirely by volunteers. It’s thanks to them that we can host our socials, run our conferences and keep the pressure on the Civil Service to do the right things for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;our business plan&lt;/a&gt; in May for the next 2 years. It sets out what we’re trying to achieve between now and December 2020. To deliver it, we’re going to need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who can spare a few hours every month to help us do our work. Below are some of the roles we are looking to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to everyone who has expressed an interest in one of these roles so far.&lt;/strong&gt; You should have now received invites to a call over the next 2 weeks to help us place you in a role, and get you started on some projects and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet expressed an interest or didn’t receive the invite, and want to get involved, you can join these conference calls. Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll send you the dial in details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conference-call-times&quot;&gt;Conference call times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For blog editor and social media managers&lt;/strong&gt;, the call is at 09:30am to 10:00am on 3 August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For governance leads&lt;/strong&gt;, the call is from 09:30am to 10:00am on 2 August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For project leaders&lt;/strong&gt;, we’ll hold two calls (you can dial in to either call for the same introduction). They will be at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:00am to 10:30am on 2 August 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:00am to 10:30am on 3 August 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For regional organisers and social coordinators&lt;/strong&gt;, we’ll hold to calls (you can dial in to either call for the same introduction). They will be at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:00am to 10:30am on 7 August 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10:30am to 11:00am on 10 August 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roles-available&quot;&gt;Roles available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#blog-editor&quot;&gt;Blog editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#governance-lead&quot;&gt;Governance lead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#project-leaders&quot;&gt;Project leaders&lt;/a&gt; (multiple posts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#regional-organisers&quot;&gt;Regional organisers&lt;/a&gt; (multiple posts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-events-coordinators&quot;&gt;Social events coordinators&lt;/a&gt; (multiple posts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-media-manager&quot;&gt;Social media manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-editor&quot;&gt;Blog editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you good with words?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for someone who can manage the blog on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be asked to produce or find blog posts each month on timely topics. That might be for an important date in the calendar — like LGBT History Month or Bi Visibility Day — or for a particular topic we want to highlight — like Pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;governance-lead&quot;&gt;Governance lead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do minutes and constitutions excite you?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for someone to run our Steering Group and Heads of Networks Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be asked to organise our major governance fora, ensure they are minuted, and follow up on any actions. You’ll also be responsible for keeping our constitution up to date and acting as returning officer for any elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-leaders&quot;&gt;Project leaders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you like delivering things?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for people who can be responsible for leading pieces of work. We’ll work with you to develop a plan for delivery and timeline, and then you just have to go and make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the projects we want people to lead at the moment include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing a best practice toolkit for departments&lt;/strong&gt;: you’ll create a toolkit that helps departments and agencies be inclusive employers, and help them demonstrate this in the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing a toolkit for completing the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/strong&gt;: you’ll curate model answers for completing the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, which departments can adapt for their own circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing a mentoring programme&lt;/strong&gt;: you’ll design and launch a national mentoring programme for LGBT+ civil servants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples. We’re looking for people who can help us deliver all the projects explained in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regional-organisers&quot;&gt;Regional organisers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you want to organise things in your local area?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for people who want to run events or lead other activities in each region of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be asked to do some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lead a Civil Service group at your local Pride, with help from us to advertise it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliver ad-hoc events using toolkits we provide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help us with campaigns by doing simple things like tweeting and putting up posters in your local offices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for more than one regional organiser in each area, so don’t worry; you won’t have to do all of those things yourself (unless you want to!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-events-coordinators&quot;&gt;Social events coordinators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you good with people and networking?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for people who want to organise local social events. &lt;strong&gt;We’re specifically looking for volunteers outside of London.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a small ask: you just need to organise one event a month, and tell us where it will be so that we can advertise it. The events can be anything you like, from drinks at a local bar to coffee mornings and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-manager&quot;&gt;Social media manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you know how to build a following?&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for someone to manage our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be asked to keep our feeds filled with the things we’re doing, like highlighting our events or publicising our blog posts. You’ll also be asked to produce regular monitoring reports on our social media reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We were delighted to be able to attend the launch event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hear Kate Scott-Hughes, Chair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cslgbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cslgbt&lt;/a&gt;, react to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGBTSurvey?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#LGBTSurvey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGBTActionPlan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#LGBTActionPlan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EqualityBenefitsEveryone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EqualityBenefitsEveryone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ERR4bBgnh9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ERR4bBgnh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Women and Equalities (@WomenEqualities) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WomenEqualities/status/1014187228552101888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-results-said&quot;&gt;What the results said&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the national LGBT survey are incredibly exciting: more than 108,000 people responded to the survey making it the largest national survey of its kind anywhere in the world. This means there is an incredibly rich evidence base for government and the Civil Service to work from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As exciting an evidence base as it is though, the results are also shocking. You’ll likely have seen some of the headline findings in the press. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than two-thirds of respondents said they avoided holding hands with their same-sex partner in public&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;70% of respondents with a minority sexual orientation and 67% of those who identified as trans said they avoided being open about being LGBT in public because they feared a negative reaction from others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2% of respondents said they had undertaken so-called “conversion therapy” and a further 5% had been offered it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are startling to many, though perhaps unsurprising to people like us who live with these issues every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey covered four main areas: health, education, safety and the workplace. As an employee network, we were most interested in the workplace findings, though the results have relevance to many parts of government in terms of policy and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-workplace&quot;&gt;The workplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workplace, the survey found that of the respondents who had a paid job in the 12 months preceding the survey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;around 1 in 5 people were not open about being LGBT with any of their colleagues at the same or a lower level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30% were not open with senior colleagues and 57% were not open with their clients or customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;around a quarter of respondents had experienced a negative or mixed reaction to them being LGBT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more than 7 in 10 people said the most serious incident they experienced was not reported&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;respondents were more likely to find staff networks, trades unions and LGBT specific charitable organisations more helpful in handling the situations they faced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures are more stark than results from other exercises like the Civil Service People Survey; particularly in relation to the amount of workplace bullying and harassment that may be occurring. They also endorse the existence of networks like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report&quot;&gt;read the full results from the LGBT survey&lt;/a&gt; on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-the-results-mean-for-the-civil-service&quot;&gt;What do the results mean for the Civil Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service has made several commitments in response to the findings of the survey. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Civil Service will continue to role model best practice in establishing working environments that are inclusive for LGBT staff in accordance with the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. We will continue our work to review and strengthen how we tackle bullying, harassment and misconduct in the Civil Service, implementing and building on the review carried out between Autumn 2017 and Summer 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We will ensure the Civil Service is an exemplar employer for collecting data on sexual orientation and gender identity in a sensitive, respectful and proportionate way. Civil Service HR, the Office for National Statistics and the Government Equalities Office will work to develop standardised questions for inclusion in internal departmental systems such as human resources systems for government employees. Civil Service HR will continue to include questions on sexual orientation and gender identity in the annual Civil Service People Survey so that the diverse workplace experiences of civil servants can be better understood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The Civil Service will demonstrate its own commitment to becoming the UK’s most inclusive employer by having a presence at Pride events each year and by supporting departmental staff networks and all staff across gender, ethnicity, faith and belief, age and disability to engage with these events.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the commitments that the Civil Service has made in response to the survey findings. We will work closely with the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion team to ensure that the commitments that have been made are delivered. And, of course, we will continue to organise participation in pride events across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/12/pride-in-london-2018-was-our-best-yet/">&lt;p&gt;On 7 July 2018, we took part in Pride in London’s annual celebrations and parade. This year was our best yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-best-group-yet--and-the-most-in-demand&quot;&gt;Our best group yet – and the most in demand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we had 120 civil servants join us in the parade. More than 2,000 people tried to get a place in the group this year: and we had hundreds on our waiting list for extra places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/images/store/posts/whole-group-pride-in-london.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our parade group at Pride in London&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were joined by 4 Permanent Secretaries on the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Richard Heaton from the Ministry of Justice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sue Owen from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clare Moriarty from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Antonia Romeo from the Department of International Trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the support of senior leaders across government is incredibly important. It means that we can demonstrate the open and inclusive environment we want to see in every part of the Civil Service in one of the most visible ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is what an inclusive Civil Service looks like. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cslgbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cslgbt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCivilService?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@UKCivilService&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideInLondon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PrideInLondon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideMatters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PrideMatters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EqualityBenefitsEveryone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EqualityBenefitsEveryone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pride2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Pride2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/a9s1FntFGh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/a9s1FntFGh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Women and Equalities (@WomenEqualities) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WomenEqualities/status/1015652218870161409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in more than 5 years, we also had a float as part of our parade group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Look out for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cslgbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cslgbt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCivilService?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@UKCivilService&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pride2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Pride2018&lt;/a&gt; float &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideInLondon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PrideInLondon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideMatters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PrideMatters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EqualityBenefitsEveryone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EqualityBenefitsEveryone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PGoDoE6qdF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PGoDoE6qdF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Women and Equalities (@WomenEqualities) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WomenEqualities/status/1015589146939875328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photos-from-the-day&quot;&gt;Photos from the day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put a lot of the photos we took from the day on Flickr. If you’ve got more photos you’d like to share, &lt;a href=&quot;/about/contact-us/&quot;&gt;send them to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/gp/civilservicelgbt/230213&quot;&gt;Look at the photos on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-yous&quot;&gt;Thank yous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank the Government Equalities Office, Cabinet Office Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Team, Department for International Trade and Government Legal Department for their support in making this year’s parade group happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also like to thank Dan, Jessica, Louis, Rebecca, Rob and Yiannis who acted as our “wheel walkers” for our float. Without them, the float wouldn’t have happened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks also to Sonia and Laurence from the Cabinet Office who designed our ‘Inclusive Civil Service’ placards and banners for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course thank you to everyone else who attended, either in the parade group or on the route cheering us on. You made the day extra special for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-will-do-differently-next-time&quot;&gt;What we will do differently next time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we had a great time, there are a few things we are already considering doing differently for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that so many people want to take part in our London parade groups. Unfortunately, due to restrictions put in place by Pride in London to ensure safety on the day, it’s not possible for everyone to be part of our group, but we continue to look at better ways to ensure a fairer allocation of spaces. Whilst we do regularly take part in pride events across the UK, we will look again to take part in a larger number of parades outside London next year, so that more people get the chance to take part.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/09/statement-on-anti-trans-protestors-at-pride-in-london/">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network took part in the Pride in London parade. We were joined by over 100 LGBT+ civil servants and allies. Together, we were united in a message of acceptance, love and respect for everyone, no matter what their gender identity or sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were preparing to take part in the parade, we understand that a protest group, demonstrating against trans people, took control of the front of the parade. We did not see the events that unfolded; we only know about the them through press reports and social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have read has saddened and shocked us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were proud this year, as we have for many years, to have trans people as part of our parade group. We will continue to champion the rights of trans people at work, and continue to support them in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are clear: trans people deserve to live with dignity and respect. The courage that trans people have to be themselves every day in the face of such blatant transphobia is something for us all to admire. Trans people bring a diversity to the Civil Service that is a strength and a benefit to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware of, and acknowledge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prideinlondon.org/news/2018/7/8/statement-from-pride-in-london-regarding-the-2018-protest-group&quot;&gt;the statement from Pride in London&lt;/a&gt; following these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that the organisers were faced with a difficult set of choices in deciding how to react to the situation. They have said they will look into what they could have done differently, and we expectantly await their proposals for next year. We do not want to see this happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise that what happened was not the fault of the dedicated volunteers that help to organise Pride in London each year. Volunteers who, we should not forget, we would not have a Pride in our capital without. Ultimately, the only people who were to blame for what happened were the protesters who set out to alienate and exclude a valued part of our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fully expect to take part in Pride in London again next year, and demonstrate that we are an inclusive and welcoming employer for trans people. We hope that others will approach next year’s event with the same level of compassion and respect for their peers as we will.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">The Fast Stream LGBT+ Network introduce their new handbook</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/09/read-the-new-fast-stream-lgbt-network-handbook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Fast Stream LGBT+ Network introduce their new handbook" />

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/09/read-the-new-fast-stream-lgbt-network-handbook/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Fast Stream LGBT+ network have written a new handbook.  It provides a great guide for LGBT+ Fast Streamers while also helping allies and managers provide better support. The handbook’s author Niki Wood had the support of the Fast Stream LGBT+ network, Civil Service LGBT+ Network, LGBT Champions, A:Gender and other trusted sources. Fast Stream LGBT+ Network Chair Rhys Roberts introduces the new handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the Fast Stream is designed to be challenging. For many it requires moving away from support systems and moving around the country for three to four years. Combine that with your first posting probably being either your first job since university, first experience in the public sector or both. This is where being an LGBT+ Fast Streamer becomes tricky. When considering to bring your whole self to work, the prospect of revealing your sexual orientation or gender identity at each new posting can be intimidating and exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first joined the Fast Stream I had an identity crisis around being a ‘high achieving’ Fast Streamer and being myself which was making the experience miserable for me. It was around this time that I became chair of the Fast Stream LGBT Network. My manager commented that I was demonstrating a spark leading that network which I wasn’t translating across into my day job. It was this observation that made me realise how important the network was to my wellbeing and professional development. I was able to practice skills in a safe environment that I may not have been getting at work. I could talk to like-minded individuals who understood the pressures and educate myself through the experiences of others. I can honestly say that I have been able to connect the dots between my work with the network and my day job and I’ve never been more comfortable with myself both in and out of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the LGBT+ handbook. A labour of love for the past 10 months in our personal time. We have created a document that attempts to condense and signpost the offer that is out there. Not just for LGBT+ Fast Streamers but also those who wish to be allies to their LGBT+ colleagues. It outlines some of the identity-specific challenges faced by those who identify within the LGBT+ spectrum and the welfare options available. It introduces the Fast Stream LGBT+ Network, its committee, and all the networks available to those working in the Civil Service. Most importantly, it outlines experiences of Fast Streamers. Of being included, supported, and accepted within the Fast Stream and Civil Service more broadly. And how to get involved in the LGBT+ movements across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network has come leaps and bounds since its initial creation. This handbook is a beacon to highlight this and the fantastic committee we have leading it. I hope that it is a useful resource and encourages you, the reader, to interact with the network in the future in whatever capacity you feel most comfortable with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get more involved, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/groups/FastStreamLGBT&quot;&gt;find us on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and follow us on Instagram &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/fast_stream_lgbt&quot;&gt;@fast_stream_lgbt&lt;/a&gt;. You can also subscribe to our mailing list by &lt;a href=&quot;lgbt.fast.stream@gmail.com&quot;&gt;emailing us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/07/02/you-are-not-alone-the-power-of-staff-networks/">&lt;p&gt;At this very moment, one of my colleagues feels like a freak. One of your colleagues feels like a freak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That person is probably sitting quietly in the office, getting on with their job, feeling wretched inside. As the office banter turns to discussions about the weekend, that person isn’t going to join in. They are keeping a secret, and they don’t want to say anything that might give it up. And this could very well be because they don’t feel comfortable enough to be themselves at work; they can’t see anyone else like them in the office and they aren’t aware of any role models who are similar to them – so sadly they don’t feel ‘normal’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t like the thought of that person sitting alone, feeling desperate. As a D&amp;amp;I champion in DWP, that’s one of the reasons why I volunteered to help run a joint DWPride and HMRC PRISM LGBT+ networks stall at Civil Service Live in Blackpool last Wednesday. Civil Service Live is the government’s annual, cross-department learning event, attracting thousands of civil servants to regional events to learn, network and share best practice, so it’s the ideal place to showcase our networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my day job I advocate the benefits of a career in DWP Digital and I truly believe that one of the fantastic things about working here is that in the Civil Service, we &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; diverse, we &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; inclusive. We don’t just want you to come to the party – we want you up dancing with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In DWP we have hundreds of offices, and although we have a thriving LGBT+ network for colleagues - &lt;em&gt;DWPride&lt;/em&gt; - if you’re working in a tiny jobcentre somewhere, there’s a chance that you don’t know about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-power-in-people&quot;&gt;The power in people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot underestimate the power of a network. Bringing together people with shared minority characteristics is a powerful, visible sign that you’re not alone. Actually there are lots of people just like you! Not only that, but these people may have had, or be having similar experiences to you. And, the people championing these networks want to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of role models and leads who want to assist you, discuss any issues you’re having and help you find the support you need. Not only that, but networks aren’t an exclusive club for those identifying with a minority characteristic, they are for allies too. At Civil Service Live, one of the most important things we did was sign-up allies; people who are team leaders and line managers. We passed out our flyers and asked them to spread the word when they get back to their offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re reading this now, and you’re a manager of an individual or a team, take the time to find out about the minority networks in your department. Talk about them at your next team meeting. This simple action could help that one lonely colleague see that they don’t have to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go on, spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service People Survey shows that colleagues identifying as bisexual or with “other” minority sexual orientations consistently report lower engagement and lower wellbeing than their gay, lesbian and heterosexual colleagues. They are also more likely to report being a victim of bullying, harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand these results in more detail so we could do something about them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network carried out a consultation on the specific experiences of bisexual, pansexual, asexual and queer civil servants. We carried out focus groups and interviews across the country and across departments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These results were analysed by an HR professional. They identified common themes from the consultation and developed proposals for activities we could undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document summarises the findings, and the things the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will do, working with the Civil Service’s Diversity and Inclusion Team, to improve the experiences of civil servants identifying as bisexual, pansexual, asexual and queer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-identified-and-our-response&quot;&gt;Issues identified and our response&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respondents to our consultation cited a lack of community and a lack of visible role models for bisexual civil servants and those with other minority sexual orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To start to address these issues, we will run a series of community events for colleagues called “Bi Space”. These will include small, safe-space events that are not centred around bar/club culture. These will be accompanied by a mailing list in order to share information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;bi-visibility&quot;&gt;Bi-visibility&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respondents to our consultation said they can sometimes feel that their identity is invisible, ignored or erased. This can relate to official documentation, community spaces, or a sense of personal invisibility in the world. They said this can also make it difficult to come out and be accepted in the workplace as themselves, thereby perpetuating the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To start to address these issues, we will:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;work with departmental LGBT+ networks to support them to be actively inclusive of those who identify as bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer or with other minority identities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as part of our plan to share best practice across departments, work with Civil Service diversity and inclusion teams to ensure departments know how to recognise these identities and sign-post staff to relevant materials, networks and role models that specifically cater to their needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;continue to celebrate Bisexual Visibility Day and raise the profile of bisexual civil servants, as seen in our &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2016/09/19/watch-csra-talks-bisexuality/&quot;&gt;CSRA Talks Bisexuality event&lt;/a&gt;, blogs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/impact-index&quot;&gt;Civil Service Impact Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-information-and-support&quot;&gt;Knowledge, information and support&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respondents to our consultation said that they often found themselves in a position where they were perceived as a source of knowledge on LGBT+ issues amongst their colleagues. Whilst an environment of open questions and peer-to-peer learning is a positive one, this put considerable strain on those individuals who may not have the information themselves, may not feel comfortable answering personal questions, and who are also trying to do their day job. They said this sense of strain was sometimes exacerbated by a well-intentioned desire to role model and do things for others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To support those civil servants in these situations, we will work with colleagues to develop a series of factsheets. These can be shared by networks and HR functions in order to raise awareness of the full range of LGBT+ identities in the general workforce. They can also be used as a source of information which bisexual, asexual and polyamorous people can share with their colleagues in order to avoid answering all the questions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;bullying-harassment-and-discrimination&quot;&gt;Bullying, harassment and discrimination&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When discussing the high level of discrimination, bullying and harassment that bisexual and “other” civil servants report in the Civil Service People Survey, respondents cited that this stems from assumptions and misconceptions around bisexuality and asexuality. They said this was accompanied by an inconsistent approach to tackling these issues between work teams, cultures, managers and even within LGBT+ communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To begin to address this issue, we will investigate how training and guidance can be developed or improved to tackle discrimination, bullying and harassment within the wider Civil Service, and also within LGBT spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;intersectionality&quot;&gt;Intersectionality&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Respondents to our consultation describe how those who experience an LGBT+ identity in interaction with other minority identities such as ethnicity, faith, gender and disability can experience more and greater barriers to participation in the workplace, and tend to be less likely to access support and community spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To begin to address this, we will begin to work more explicitly with other Civil Service diversity networks, including by organising joint events.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/03/31/gender-diversity-matters-event/">&lt;p&gt;Hi. I’m Shelley and I’m the Yorkshire and Humberside regional lead for DWP’s LGBT* network, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dw.pride@dwp.gsi.gov.uk&quot;&gt;DWPride&lt;/a&gt;. I’m passionate about increasing awareness of diversity and inclusion in DWP and more widely across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that a lot of the work we see on LGBT+ issues focus on lesbian and gay people, but that there is comparatively little about the transgender and other minority identities. I wanted to do something about it; so I decided to organise an event where we could talk about the experiences of these communities in Yorkshire and Humber, specifically focusing on transgender and intersex people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to me that I help to spread the message that as civil servants, it’s vital that we understand and have empathy with people from a wide range of diversity groups. This includes people who have more than one characteristic to who they are. For example that person could be a lesbian with mental health problems and from an ethnic minority group, or a disabled, transgender man. We are either providing services for, or working with, people like them and we need to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-great-event&quot;&gt;A great event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Jenny Turner from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/dhsc&quot;&gt;Department of Health and Social Care&lt;/a&gt;, I’d managed to contact most government departments and it wasn’t long before requests to attend the event were coming in thick and fast. I still worried that we’d not get enough interest to justify the effort or fill the room, though. How wrong I was! Seats were ‘sold out’ with every seat filled on the day. This was no mean feat for a Friday at half-term. And I’m delighted to say that it was an outstanding success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the event I nervously watched delegates’ reactions to the speakers. Everyone was absolutely captivated by them. Their personal stories were both moving and engaging. It was a real roller-coaster of a ride, with tears of empathy one minute and full-on belly laughs the next. Everyone was totally mesmerised by the way the speakers shared personal details about their lives and the way this brought their challenges and celebrations to life for everyone. And the feedback has been so positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-learnt&quot;&gt;What I learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The messages I took away from the event include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These are not life choices – no one would choose to face the challenges trans and intersex people face if it was a ‘choice’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If someone comes out to you as intersex or trans, ask them what they need from you and how they want to be treated – don’t presume or hide behind process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It isn’t just the person coming out that we need to remember to support – there are family, loved ones and colleagues who may also need support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have a lot of good guidelines, policies and practices in the Civil Service there is still a lot more we can do. This can vary from designing services and forms that include different gender options, to creating policies that support parents and partners of people transitioning. The list of actions we could take is long so I’ll not go on, but put simply we need to consciously think beyond the binary of male and female in everything we design, build and do.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/03/26/say-hello-civil-service-lgbt-network/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, we’re changing our name to become the Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/strong&gt;. This blog post tells you a little about why we’re doing that, and what it means in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-have-changed&quot;&gt;Things have changed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Civil Service Rainbow Alliance&lt;/em&gt; is now more than a decade old. In that time we have helped to raise the visibility of staff with minority sexual orientations and gender identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contexts in which LGBT+ civil servants work now, though, are radically different from just a decade ago when CSRA was in its infancy. The law is substantially different now, the workplace has changed too, and the challenges facing LGBT+ civil servants are new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to ensure that this network is relevant for the next 10 years and beyond, so we’ve been thinking about what comes next for CSRA. We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/publication/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/&quot;&gt;launched a consultation&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;/consultation/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/&quot;&gt;you can feedback on&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re changing our name too as a first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-name-that-reflects-our-ambitions&quot;&gt;A name that reflects our ambitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to be a network that is accessible to everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: and we wanted a name that reflected that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted it to be easy for people to understand and identify with. Our new name — which includes the term ‘LGBT’ — makes who we are obvious and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted our name to demonstrate that this network is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; with a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics: which is why we’ve added a ‘plus’ to our name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-you-can-find-us&quot;&gt;Where you can find us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new name comes with some new branding, but more importantly, we’ve changed where you can find us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve got a new website and a new web address.&lt;/strong&gt; You can now find us at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There, you’ll be able to find all our news and events as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our social media handles have changed.&lt;/strong&gt; You can now find us on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; where our handle is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/cslgbt&quot;&gt;@cslgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; where our Facebook Page is now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/civilservicelgbt&quot;&gt;facebook.com/civilservicelgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram&lt;/strong&gt; where our handle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/civilservicelgbt&quot;&gt;@civilservicelgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flickr&lt;/strong&gt; where we’ve changed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/civilservicelgbt/&quot;&gt;civilservicelgbt&lt;/a&gt; too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our email addresses have changed too&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now reach us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;, and any other email addresses we use now end in @civilservice.lgbt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll start to see all our branding and related things change over the next week or so. We’ll make it obvious where things are changing, so you don’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-will-we-use-the-information-about-you&quot;&gt;How will we use the information about you?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We collect information about you so that we can:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send you tickets to events you register for, and keep you informed about changes to event details&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;send you information we think might be of interest to you about LGBT+ issues in the Civil Service through our regular email alerts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;follow up with you when you submit information to consultations or similar activities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;understand who our members are and what they might be interested in so we can plan our work to be relevant to our membership&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;improve our website and email alerts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So that we can provide you with services, we use your data when:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you have given explicit consent&lt;/strong&gt;: we sometimes explicitly ask you to give clear, explicit consent for us to use your personal data&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it is in our legitimate interests&lt;/strong&gt;: we sometimes use your personal data when it is necessary to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In all cases, we use this data so that we can provide you with services or information that is relevant to you as an LGBT+ civil servant, ally or other person interested in our work, and inline with &lt;a href=&quot;/about/constitution&quot;&gt;our constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:lawful-basis&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:lawful-basis&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where we collect sensitive personal data, like information about your sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or whether you have a disability, this is processed on the same basis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:special-cat-data&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:special-cat-data&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We will not share your personal information with other organisations for marketing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We use several third party services to store and use data you provide to us, so that we can provide our services to you. These include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOV.UK Notify&lt;/strong&gt; for bulk email&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/strong&gt; for our events management&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; for our email and office software&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/strong&gt; who provide the hosting for our forum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-we-protect-your-information&quot;&gt;How do we protect your information?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-your-data-retention-policy&quot;&gt;What is your data retention policy?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We aim to only retain information for as long as is strictly necessary to provide you with a service. We regularly review and delete data that we believe we no longer need to provide you with the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In November 2017, we took over responsibility for leading the cross-government network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil servants: the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance. Since then, we’ve been working to develop a bold and ambitious plan for what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, this network has helped to raise the visibility of staff with minority sexual orientations and gender identities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The network has evolved in that time. It started as a network of networks, just for lesbian, gay and bisexual civil servants, focused on community building. Today, we regularly host social, networking, and learning and development events for hundreds of staff across the country. We are also a representative organisation with dozens of volunteers and more than 1,300 members nationally, as well as connections with all the Civil Service departmental and agency LGBT+ networks. Importantly, the network also now explicitly welcomes staff who identify as trans too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a network, the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance needs to continue to evolve. The contexts in which LGBT+ civil servants work are now radically different from just a decade ago. The law is substantially different now, and the challenges facing LGBT+ civil servants are new. We want to ensure that this network is relevant for the next 10 years and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That’s what this document is for: to explain our vision for a better Civil Service for LGBT+ people and how we’re going to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This plan is open for consultation for the next month. We’d like to know what you want from us, from this network and from the Civil Service so that, together, we can help turn the Civil Service into the UK’s most inclusive employer for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Scott-Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, Chair&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Peart&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice-Chair&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This document explains our plans for the cross-government LGBT+ network for the next 2 years. It builds upon the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance’s “LGB* Action Plan”, released in November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The plans in this document are open for consultation. The consultation will close on 20 April 2018. Following the close of the consultation, we will publish a full work plan and an annual report on our progress in delivering that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This consultation is open to everyone who has a minority sexual orientation or gender identity working in the UK Civil Service. This includes all staff working in departments and agencies and non-departmental public bodies listed on GOV.UK. It also includes staff from crown bodies that are affiliated with the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can respond to this consultation in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;by sending your feedback to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;by completing our online questionnaire, which can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/consultation/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/&quot;&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’re also looking for volunteers to help us deliver this plan. If you’re interested, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-our-network-should-be-for&quot;&gt;What our network should be for&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe that the Civil Service is at its best when it represents the diversity of the country we serve, and when civil servants can bring their best selves to work without fear or compromise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service Rainbow Alliance has transformed from an informal social group, to a respected and influential staff network in the last decade. The network currently represents staff to senior management, informs policy development and provides a social and development space for LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service has changed too: it now wants to become “the UK’s most inclusive employer”. On every available measure, the experience of staff who define as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is worse than the experience of other civil servants. To become the UK’s most inclusive employer, the Civil Service must address the experiences of LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a cross-government network, we believe we should support and challenge the Civil Service to do better for its LGBT+ staff.&lt;/strong&gt; Our role is to represent the views of LGBT+ civil servants, and be a critical friend for senior leaders and policy officials who are responsible for diversity and inclusion in the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know we can’t do that alone: cross-government networks are at their best when they are supported by strong and stable local networks. We know that it is difficult and time-intensive to run a local network in a department or agency, and that too often the support is not in place to make the job of local network leaders easy. Ultimately, we want everyone to have access to a local network they trust and that is supported by their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a cross-government network, we believe we should support the development of local networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Our role is to support local networks, so that they have the resources and tools they need to deliver in their own organisations. It’s also our role to spot the work that is happening in common across government and join up those efforts where we see them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;CSRA also has a proud record of community building. In the last 5 years, we’ve engaged hundreds of civil servants in national Pride events, put on several major conferences, and run dozens of social and networking events in every part of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a cross-government network, we believe we should continue to build a community for LGBT+ staff.&lt;/strong&gt; Our role is to provide the social, networking, and learning and development opportunities for staff to help them connect with other people like them, and to progress in their Civil Service journey. Our role is to ensure that, no matter how someone identifies or where they live, every LGBT+ civil servant feels connected to a a cross-government community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-civil-service-lgbt-network&quot;&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Network&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This month, we will be changing our name to become the Civil Service LGBT+ Network (or CSLGBT+ for short).&lt;/strong&gt; Our new name reflects our new ambitions for our network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to be a network that is accessible to everyone.&lt;/strong&gt; Our old name prompted more questions than it provided answers, and people couldn’t easily find us or find out what we did. It’s also why we’re including a ‘plus’ - because we want to put our ambition of inclusion at the forefront of everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe that in combining what makes us all different, we come together to make something better and bigger than the sum of the parts.&lt;/strong&gt; So, this month, we’ll also be changing our branding. You can see some of it in this document. In print design, designers work with 4 base colours - cyan, magenta, yellow and black - and combine them to make all the colours they need. Our new brand is based on the same idea: it reflects our belief that many parts come together to make a better, bolder whole.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over the next month, you’ll see us adopt our new name in more places, use our branding in new ways, launch a new website, and change our social media presence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;our-plan&quot;&gt;Our plan&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This plan covers 4 priority areas, and some proposals for how we can act on them. These priorities and ideas have been developed over the last 3 months through discussions with networks and members.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;consultation&quot;&gt;Consultation&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This plan is subject to consultation. If you have ideas for different ways we could address the issues highlighted in this document, then we’d love to hear it. You can send your feedback in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;by sending your feedback to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;by completing our online questionnaire, which can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservice.lgbt/consultation/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/&quot;&gt;www.civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’re also looking for volunteers to help us deliver this plan. If you’re interested, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;priority-areas&quot;&gt;Priority areas&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We think our 4 priority areas should be:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strong and stable networks:&lt;/strong&gt; providing support and assurance for local networks, so that every civil servant can access a locally based LGBT+ network&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diverse and inclusive community:&lt;/strong&gt; doing more to actively engage under-represented groups within the LGBT+ community, such as bisexual staff and women, and working on issues faced by people with multiple protected characteristics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;national reach:&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that our activities are nationally inclusive and regionally based, and that people feel connected to a community regardless of where they live&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding and representing your needs:&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that all our work is evidence based and that we accurately represent the views of our members to stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For each of these priority areas, we have identified a set of projects to deliver. These are detailed later in this document.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-we-will-deliver-this-plan&quot;&gt;How we will deliver this plan&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Civil Service Rainbow Alliance has traditionally led its work through volunteer teams focused on a number of ‘themes’: we intend to do things differently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our current team structure is based around 4 large teams with broad remits. These are the ‘Corporate’ team, the ‘Network Engagement’ team, ‘Communities’ team and the ‘Regions’ team. This structure has allowed CSRA to involve lots of people quickly, however it has also led to volunteers sometimes being unclear about their roles and how they can easily contribute. It has also placed a large burden on some of our volunteers in an unsustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead of a few large volunteer teams with broad remits, we will be establishing lots of smaller project teams to deliver smaller, more focused pieces of work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the next month, we intend to disband the old team structure, replacing ‘officers’ and ‘representatives’ with a new system of ‘project leaders’ and ‘local organisers’.&lt;/strong&gt; This will give people clear ownership of a piece of work they can lead, and also not ask too much of volunteers. Each volunteer team will work with either the Chair or Vice-Chair to develop a clear project plan, so that they can focus on doing the important part: delivering for LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For each of the projects outlined below, we need volunteers.&lt;/strong&gt; Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;info@civilservice.lgbt&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to lead one of the projects here, or if you have ideas of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;strong-and-stable-networks&quot;&gt;Strong and stable networks&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The way that local departmental and agency networks are resourced and managed has changed significantly in the last ten years. Over that time our member networks have evolved and the functions they fulfil have also evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe every civil servant should have access to a local network that they can trust to support them.&lt;/strong&gt; To do that, networks need to be well resourced, with volunteers being given the space to transform the experience of staff in their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to support local networks by removing duplication across government, sharing best practice, and ensuring we make the case for well resourced supported networks. We also want to ensure networks can hold the Civil Service LGBT+ Network to account for our delivery, and shape the work we do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;heads-of-networks-forum&quot;&gt;Heads of Networks Forum&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know from experience that running an employee network can be a challenging and difficult task and can sometimes feel isolated, especially when dealing with confidential issues and politically sensitive problems. We want to create a forum where network leaders can collaborate and work together to support one another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a Heads of Networks Forum. The Forum will help shape the work of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and give the leaders of local LGBT+ networks a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;support-for-the-workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;Support for the Workplace Equality Index&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service wants to be the UK’s most inclusive employer; a fundamental part of demonstrating this will be benchmarking exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the early years of the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, Civil Service organisations were very well represented. In recent years there have been various departments and agencies which have struggled with achieving Top 100 status despite doing good work. We believe that this is partly down to how different submissions are being written and how central policies are written.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a team to identify the areas Civil Service organisations do well, and where they do not. The team will create a toolkit that will help Civil Service organisations complete their Workplace Equality Index submissions, focusing on areas that are common across departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-development-and-assurance&quot;&gt;Policy development and assurance&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Civil Service organisations have a wide variety of policies and procedures in place to support LGBT+ staff. These vary in both scope and quality. We know local networks sometimes want to understand how policies operate in other organisations. The Civil Service also regularly consults on policy development that applies across all organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a service that can be used by local networks, ensuring they have access to best practice guidance on various policy issues. We will also form a team to create model policies that can be used as an influencing tool internal to departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also create a team focused on regular consultation with members, and developing policy responses on behalf of our members and all local networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;diverse-and-inclusive-community&quot;&gt;Diverse and inclusive community&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The evidence base consistently indicates that the experience of LGBT+ civil servants is worse than non-LGBT+ civil servants, and that each part of the LGBT+ community faces different experiences too. It also indicates and that LGBT+ civil servants who have another under-represented protected characteristic — like women and people from black and minority ethnicity backgrounds — are less engaged than their colleagues. The anecdotal feedback we receive is that these individuals feel isolated and need more easily identifiable community support.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe we should build a community that is inclusive of all LGBT+ staff.&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, we want to ensure we actively engage under-represented groups within our own community — like lesbian and bisexual staff, and women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to create a truly diverse, active, and highly-engaged community that represents the whole Civil Service and wider country.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;community-space-for-bisexual-civil-servants&quot;&gt;Community space for bisexual civil servants&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Compared to lesbian and gay people, bisexual civil servants report lower levels of engagement in the Civil Service People Survey. Research undertaken by CSRA last year has shown that bisexual staff regularly feel invisible in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will establish a new initiative — ‘BiSpace’ — that will provide a community space specifically for bisexual civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;intersectionality&quot;&gt;Intersectionality&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know that people with a religion or belief can find it difficult to reconcile their belief with their sexuality and can also experience discrimination from both the LGBT+ community and their religious community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will establish a project to understand the experience of LGBT+ staff who are also part of a religious community. This will help us to better understand those issues and how we can support civil servants in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have had a long association with a:gender — the staff network for trans, non-binary and intersex people — working together to champion the rights of LGBT+ staff. We are changing to LGBT+ to reflect that openness and collaborative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the same way the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, as a network of local LGBT+ networks, is stronger than the sum of its parts, we recognise that our network is stronger if we work with other cross-government networks. Collaboration with other staff networks means we can better support our membership better and and better influence the Civil Service to make good  decisions for LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will work with Cabinet Office to foster improved relationships with other staff networks, and increase understanding across all of them of the issues faced by LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To underpin all of this work we will establish a project to identify how we can engage and support LGBT+ allies across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;national-reach&quot;&gt;National reach&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over 80% of LGBT+ civil servants are based outside of London. We are a national network, and we need to do more to support staff living across the whole of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe that every LGBT+ civil servant should be able to access events and community activities in cities and towns near them.&lt;/strong&gt; To do this, we need empowered regional organisers who lead activity in their local area. We also need to ensure that participation doesn’t rely on physically attending events.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our goal is that no one is excluded from our events or activities on the basis of where they live, and that staff living outside major urban areas receive as much support as those in cities where LGBT+ civil servants are clustered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;digitally-enabled-communities&quot;&gt;Digitally-enabled communities&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As the Civil Service becomes a more flexible, agile organisation, civil servants will move more frequently between organisations. They may also change their place of work, disconnecting them from existing networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We want to ensure that, underpinning this flexibility, people feel like they have access to a community of people like them. That community should be accessible wherever they go, and it shouldn’t rely on physically meeting to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a digital space that allows LGBT+ civil servants to meet others and feel connected to other people like them, even when they don’t live nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;regional-organiser-support&quot;&gt;Regional organiser support&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Strong communities need to be actively led by dedicated and well supported volunteers, but organising local activities can be time consuming, regardless of where you live. It can also be intimidating when you’re doing something new and learning as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a team of regional organisers who will lead small pieces of local community building activity — such as social events or campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also create toolkits to support regional organisers, making local events easier to organise and increase the number of events held outside London.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;mentoring&quot;&gt;Mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance committed to establishing a national mentoring scheme for LGBT+ civil servants. Following engagement with Civil Service HR and local network leaders, we believe there is a clear need for this work to be completed. One of the key challenges in establishing a mentoring scheme is the administrative capacity required to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will establish a team to develop a national mentoring scheme that is sustainable and tailored to the needs of LGBT+ civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-and-representing-your-needs&quot;&gt;Understanding and representing your needs&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We exist to support our members and member networks. To do that we need to know what your needs are so we can represent them in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe the Civil Service LGBT+ Network can only properly represent LGBT+ staff if we have a deep understanding of what LGBT+ staff need.&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is to regularly consult with staff on issues that matter to them, and ensure that our work is grounded in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to be a trusted source of expertise and insight, and to be accountable for the decisions we take on behalf of our members.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis-and-insight&quot;&gt;Analysis and insight&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understanding user needs is important if we are to deliver successful services to our members, and represent their views effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will run regular consultations on policy issues, ensuring our policy stances are informed by your views as well as wider evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will establish an annual Civil Service LGBT+ survey which will ask you what you would like us to focus on and how you would like us to represent you. We will also publish regular reports on our progress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will carry out an annual analysis of the Civil Service People Survey, drawing together the information on LGBT+ civil servants across all organisations and identifying some of the issues that cannot be seen at departmental or agency level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will continue to work with Cabinet Office on issues relating to monitoring of sexual orientation and gender identity questions in HR systems and the Civil Service People Survey&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;representation&quot;&gt;Representation&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A fundamental role of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network is to represent the views of LGBT+ staff to senior managers and the wider Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will continue to meet regularly with the Civil Service LGBTI Champion and Diversity Champion, Sue Owen, to raise issues, brief her on progress and initiatives and advise her on actions which need to be taken to improve the experience of LGBT+ staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also continue to work with the Civil Service Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion team to influence policy and culture within the Civil Service, working with other staff networks and with Heads of Diversity to make the Civil Service a better place to work for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2018/01/31/civil-service-departments-shine-in-stonewall-index/">&lt;p&gt;Stonewall have launched their &lt;a href=&quot;https://stonewall.org.uk/wei&quot;&gt;Workplace Equality Index for 2018&lt;/a&gt;. This year, 9 Civil Service organisations feature in the Top 100 - with a number of central government departments re-entering the list after several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Welsh Government was the top Civil Service organisation in the Index, coming 12th, and closely followed by Ministry of Justice and the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;38&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Home Office&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;MI6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;GCHQ&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Department for Education&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;93&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property Office&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stonewall have also awarded Andy Holmes, from HM Prisons and Probation Service, a special award for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonewall.org.uk/people/andy-holmes-ally-year-2018&quot;&gt;Ally of the Year 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Holmes is an active LGBT ally within the Ministry of Justice LGBT employee network, SPIRIT, setting up the UK’s first LGBT network for prisoners and rolling this out across the UK. Since taking on the role of building LGBT awareness in the prison service, Andy has led 76 sessions at 44 prison establishments, reaching over 950 prisoners and almost 2,500 employees. &lt;strong&gt;Congratulations Andy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several departments have also jumped up the Index outside the Top 100. Public Health England have jumped more than 60 places in this year’s Index - rising to 115th - and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (formerly DCLG) rose by more than 110 places in this year’s index to 199th place. The Department for International Trade rose 143 places in the Index this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to everyone in the Index - and especially those in the Top 100.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the Stonewall Index is an important tool for putting LGBT inclusion at work on the agenda of Civil Service organisations. We’re going to launching new work this year to support networks in improving their workplace inclusion, and in entering the Index for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/11/03/a-message-from-the-new-chair-and-vice-chair</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/11/03/a-message-from-the-new-chair-and-vice-chair/">&lt;p&gt;This week, we’ve taken over responsibility for running CSRA as Chair and Vice-Chair. We’ve both played an important part of developing CSRA over the past few years, and now we’re both really excited to start working on what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written this note to share a bit about our joint priorities, and to let you know about what’s going to start happening soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you-to-ollie&quot;&gt;Thank you to Ollie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to start by saying “thank you” to Ollie Entwistle, who has led CSRA for the last 9 years. In that time, he’s made CSRA one of the most influential and visible staff networks in the Civil Service, and we are proud to take over from him. We were thrilled that he was recognised for his efforts at our &lt;a href=&quot;//www.civilservice.lgbt/impact-index&quot;&gt;Impact Index&lt;/a&gt; event last month, and we’re sure he’ll continue to be a powerful voice for LGBT civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-priorities&quot;&gt;Our priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met last week to discuss our joint priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, we will be spending some time recruiting some new volunteers and establishing a plan of work for the next 12 months. We want to focus in 3 areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting departmental networks to develop and deliver great support for their members&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing sustainable regional support, including better support for volunteers in the regions around the UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;starting focused projects to improve the experience of civil servants who define themselves as bisexual, trans and ‘other’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be thinking about how we build upon the success of CSRA’s existing work, like our social events, our conference, and how we celebrate LGBT History Month and Pride in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-going-to-need-your-help&quot;&gt;We’re going to need your help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our plans, we’re going to need some help. We’ve had a small but dedicated team of volunteers working on CSRA projects for the last few years. Some of those volunteers can no longer be involved, due to other commitments, so we’re thinking about how we rebuild a team of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for volunteering opportunities in the coming weeks and months on some of our new project work, and to help with running CSRA as a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we’re in this planning phase, we’ll probably be a bit quieter than usual: but our usual activities, like our &lt;a href=&quot;//www.civilservice.lgbt/events/&quot;&gt;social events&lt;/a&gt;, will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got any questions, or you want to raise an idea for something we could do, do &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@ukcsra.com&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with us.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are proud to introduce the first ever Civil Service LGBT+ Impact Index.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service LGBT+ Impact Index celebrates the civil servants making things better for LGBT+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Impact Index is a new initiative from the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance - the network representing LGBT+ civil servants - to recognise the important work that LGBT+ civil servants and allies do to improve the Civil Service and the public services that LGBT+ people rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/09/22/stuart-andrews-open-conversations-on-bivisibilityday/">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share my experiences for Bi Visibility Day. The Civil Service Rainbow Alliance are doing a piece of work to support colleagues identifying as bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, or with other minority sexual identities and I have agreed to give them some information on my experiences working in the Civil Service and identifying as bisexual. I wanted to share my response here too in case others felt they could draw on my support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying as a bisexual man has not always been an easy experience, but things have changed a lot in recent years. I did not come out until I was in my mid 30’s. When I joined the Civil Service as an AO in my 20’s I briefly dated a woman in my Department. After our relationship ended I heard a senior manager ask her if I was gay which I felt was really inappropriate. Within a couple of years I discovered another AO had created a false profile on a well-known gay dating website to see if I had a profile on there, so I had to take down all the pictures of me on the website in case this other colleague outed me behind my back. I didn’t know what to do so I did nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have got better but there’s still a long way to go. The launch of DWPride has really let me be me. I first came out as bisexual during Bi Visibility Day which is an important day that the Department has started to widely recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge really is power in supporting bisexuality. There are still assumptions about being greedy or undecided, or fashionable. Being bisexual isn’t some alien position, it isn’t a choice; it is just another state of definition much the same way as a person may identify as being straight or gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have asked why do we need another day to be acknowledged for LGBT? It certainly feels like a sexual orientation which people are uncomfortable talking about and there are lots of misconceptions. As the Civil Service I feel we need to open up big conversations both locally and nationally, with visible leaders identifying as bisexual role models and colleagues being comfortable in asking questions. I’d rather have colleagues ask me a million questions than a couple of uncomfortable rumours behind my back. For me, opening up conversations is what Bi Visibility Day is all about.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/09/22/queer-consultation-listening-to-bisexual-civil-servants/">&lt;p&gt;I am writing this blog post while hurtling through the British countryside on a train from Sheffield to London. I travelled to Sheffield today to conduct the final in a series of interviews and focus groups aiming to understand the experiences of bisexual, queer, asexual, and pansexual civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service, along with the society we serve, has made significant progress when it comes to acceptance, representation and support for LGBT people. This includes the ‘B’, with Bisexuality Visibility Day on 23rd September being widely recognised across departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the annual People Survey results, we know that civil servants identifying as bisexual and with the ‘other’ option are less likely to feel included at work. This is not just in comparison with our heterosexual colleagues but also in comparison with our gay and lesbian colleagues. We know that this is also the case for our overall sense of engagement, as well as our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow CSRA volunteers and I wanted to address this directly. We wanted to hear from bisexual, queer, asexual and pansexual colleagues to understand their experiences and create change. This was the catalyst for the recent consultation we have carried out. With focus groups conducted, interviews completed, and written responses provided by colleagues across the country and across government, we are one step closer to our goal.  Our next step is to use this evidence to understand the key issues and to form practical recommendations to better support this group, which we hope to launch in early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Bisexuality Visibility Day, I am reflecting on how lucky I am to have carried out this consultation, because it has given me the opportunity to meet so many dedicated and inspiring people across the Civil Service who want to create a safer, more accepting world for people of all sexualities and genders. Some have offered to share their stories with you, so that you too can help create change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-to-help-on-bi-visibility-day&quot;&gt;What can you do to help on Bi Visibility Day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/22/lucy-pedrick-lets-put-in-the-work-to-challenge-biphobia/&quot;&gt;Lucy’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/22/stuart-andrews-open-conversations-on-bivisibilityday/&quot;&gt;Stuart’s&lt;/a&gt; perspectives and share them with colleagues, friends, or on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Challenge biphobia if you feel comfortable doing so. Open, non-judgemental questions are a good way to challenge someone’s thinking in a positive and constructive way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your own assumptions and the language you use, particularly around gender. We can all make mistakes and make assumptions (including LGBT people) but by being aware of our assumptions, we can create change together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to contribute to our consultation? Are you a civil servant who identifies as bisexual, queer, asexual, pansexual, or tend to tick the ‘other’ box in the People Survey? Then it’s not too late to share your perspective! Email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mary.peart@dwp.gsi.gov.uk&quot;&gt;mary.peart@dwp.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; to see how you can be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/09/22/lucy-pedrick-lets-put-in-the-work-to-challenge-biphobia/">&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you tell your family that you’ve got an exciting new job and they laugh and don’t believe you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you mention your children to a colleague. First they tell you it’s impossible for you to be a parent, and then to keep your private business to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment that every time you have a conversation with someone about a fundamental part of who you are, they deny it. Maybe they don’t believe that it could be true of you. Maybe they don’t believe it is true of anyone. Imagine how it would feel to be told over and over and over that your identity is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what it can often feel like to talk about being bisexual. And that’s why Saturday 23 September is Bi Visibility Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bisexuality is attraction to people of more than one gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bisexual people experience exclusion not just in public spaces where we might be perceived as too gay, but also in LGBT+ spaces where we can be perceived as too straight (or not gay enough). This experience can be exacerbated by the way that we visually present our gender and/or the gender of our partner. For example, someone who is usually “read” as straight and is in a mixed sex relationship is less likely to experience overt biphobia in public spaces (although they are very likely to feel like their sexuality is invisible in those spaces) and more likely to feel overtly excluded in LGBT+ spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bi people are often accused of being liars, or greedy, or more likely to be unfaithful to our partners. This is biphobia. These myths and stereotypes contribute to our exclusion in public spaces and LGBT+ spaces alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bi in public can be an exhausting and isolating experience. When I went to my first Pride event I met a group of gay men who assumed immediately that I was there as a straight ally. It felt like I was pretending to be someone else, or watching Pride through a window. When I corrected them and explained that actually, Pride is as much for me as it is for them – that I am the ‘B’ in LGBT – they seemed almost surprised that Bi people exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year at London Pride I marched with colleagues from the DCLGBT+ and DCLG LGBT+ Allies networks, as well as others from across the civil service and CSRA. I met a bi woman from one department who told me that she nearly didn’t go this year. She was worried that people would think she wasn’t LGBT+ enough to be there because her partner is a man.
You don’t stop being a parent when your children leave home. You don’t lose your national heritage when you move to another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bi people are bi whether or not we are in a relationship. Bi people are bi whatever the gender of our partner. Bisexuality is not a phase. It’s not a fetish. It’s not a label with which we identify while we “decide” whether we are straight or gay (although some people do identify differently at different times in their lives, and that’s ok too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal symbol for bisexuality is a unicorn. It’s a running joke in the community that we’re magical, mythical beings that don’t actually exist in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that whenever public figures who have previously been in mixed-sex relationships enter into same-sex relationships, the press too often will say that they are “a lesbian now” or “gay now”.  This is Bi Invisibility. Even where bi people are out publically, it can often feel like everyone in the world is trying to rationalise our identity for us as either straight or gay, however many times we explicitly state that we are bi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think for a moment about the cumulative impact of biphobia – of being consistently mislabelled, having your partner misgendered, being told your identity is a phase or quizzed on exactly “how bi” you are – it’s not surprising that studies have consistently shown that bisexual people experience worse mental health than people of any other orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we have Bi Visibility Day. Because it matters that we can support each other and it matters that we are seen and recognised by our friends and colleagues the way that we see ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the civil service, and in DCLG, we’ve been looking at ways that we can be more bi inclusive. It’s important that we feel safe being out (if we want to be) in our workplaces, and that our LGBT networks (if we choose to engage with them) don’t perpetuate the biphobia that is all too common in the LGBT community more widely. That means not just being implicitly bi inclusive but explicitly welcoming bi members – with our language and our behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It couldn’t be more important to model bi inclusion, and part of that means not making assumptions about the kind of people we think are usually bi. However engaged you are in the LGBT community, just like every cisgender straight person knows more LGBT people than they think they do, most LGBT people know more bi people than they think they do. Like everyone, bisexual people have multiple identities. Some bi people are men. Some are women. Some are non-binary. Some bi people are disabled. Some bi people are BAME. Some bi people are trans. Some bi people are asexual. Some bi people have mental health problems. Many bi people are more than one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s put in the work, however we define our sexualities, to challenge biphobia (whoever it comes from) and to actively demonstrate that we recognise, acknowledge and welcome all bi people, always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this unicorn would like to wish everybody a very happy Bi Visibility Day for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/08/02/why-the-civil-service-took-part-in-pride-2017/">&lt;p&gt;This summer, hundreds of Civil Service staff have been taking part in Pride events across the country. So far, lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) staff and allies have been to London, Nottingham, and Hull Pride - and more will be attending Edinburgh Pride amongst others in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/perm-secs-pride-2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3 Permanent Secretaries attended our Pride in London march&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 100 staff attended Pride in London march, including Permanent Secretaries from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Ministry of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-take-part-in-pride&quot;&gt;Why we take part in Pride&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who attends these Pride events from the Civil Service does so in their spare time: they don’t have to march, and they don’t have to join the Civil Service group. But they do, and for many they do it every year. But why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as Pride marches have happened the purpose has been to put a face to LGBT people, and to show that we are not to be feared but to be loved and embraced. Civil servants come to Pride events for lots of reasons. For some it’s about that visibility of people like them; for others it’s to show support for their LGBT colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organise the Civil Service’s participation in Pride for a simple reason: because it allows everyone to see the inclusive and open Civil Service we aspire to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/dclg-pride-2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Civil servants from DCLG before the march started&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;representing-the-diversity-of-the-public-we-serve&quot;&gt;Representing the diversity of the public we serve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service is at its best when it understands what the public needs and when it reflects the diversity of the country as a whole. When people from diverse backgrounds are involved in creating the public services we all rely on, we get better services that work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity and inclusion in the Civil Service has been a top priority for the Cabinet Secretary and Civil Service Board for several years. Attending Pride events is just one way we can demonstrate how diverse we are, and highlight how far we still have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/civilservice-pride-2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Civil Service group at Pride in London&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pride-isnt-the-end&quot;&gt;Pride isn’t the end&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Pride events come but once a year - but that doesn’t mean it’s the only thing we are doing to support LGBT staff. CSRA is working on several things that will help to promote the visibility and well being of LGBT staff over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lgbt-impact-index&quot;&gt;LGBT Impact Index&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we launched our LGBT Impact Index which celebrates LGBT role models, allies, teams and networks in the Civil Service. We’ll be announcing the winners in October - so make sure you’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/join-us&quot;&gt;registered on our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ukcsra&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/ukcsra&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lgbt-history-month&quot;&gt;LGBT History Month&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started thinking about how we can celebrate LGBT History Month in 2018. If you want to get involved in your department or to volunteer with us, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-action-plan&quot;&gt;Our action plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2015 we published our &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/01/a-blueprint-for-improving-the-experiences-of-lgb-people-in-the-civil-service/&quot;&gt;action plan&lt;/a&gt; and have been working to deliver this over the last 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;until-next-time&quot;&gt;Until next time…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be organising participation in Pride again next year, as always, because it’s important we are visible and that we are counted. If you’d like to help us next year, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The conference was at the BEIS Conference Centre in central London. More than 200 civil servants representing representing over 40 government departments and agencies attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speakers-and-workshops&quot;&gt;Speakers and workshops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, we heard from 4 fantastic keynote speakers: Sue Owen, Permanent Secretary for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Civil Service Diversity Champion; Caroline Dinenage MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Women, Equalities and Early Years; Paul Twocock, Director of Campaigns, Policy and Research; and Monty Moncrieff, Chief Executive of London Friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sue Owen spoke about the progress the Civil Service is making on diversity and inclusion, and the future plans for updating the Talent Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Diversity and inclusion is more than the right thing to do.

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline Dinenage MP spoke to delegates about the important role played by the Government Equalities Office, and the proud record of successive governments in furthering the rights of LGBT people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Twocock reflected on the turbulent political events in 2017, and how we can’t take progress on equalities for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PaulTwocock&quot;&gt;@PaulTwocock&lt;/a&gt;: “2016 has shaken our view of the world for many of us, and the things we took for granted” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSRA?src=hash&quot;&gt;#CSRA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CSRA (@UKCSRA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCSRA/status/834788761976369152&quot;&gt;February 23, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monty Moncrieff spoke about the user needs LGBT people have, from the perspective of an LGBT services provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“… 3. Speak to stakeholders early&lt;br /&gt;4.

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/02/03/count-us-or-we-may-not-count/">&lt;p&gt;It seems particularly apt that this year’s &lt;a href=&quot;//lgbthistorymonth.org.uk&quot;&gt;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History Month&lt;/a&gt; theme is justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems too easy for us to ignore the needs of minorities when we are not directly touched by them or don’t consciously know someone affected. And often we find it hard to conceptualise how significant a community is or how many people may be affected when we can’t visibly see them around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invisibility of minorities is often perpetuated by data. In many ways this is understandable. It is hard to justify investment in a service for a community or issue that you can’t count, and it makes it even harder to demonstrate impact if you don’t know what you’re baselining the uptake against. It also creates a perpetuating loop of invisibility in research and evidence bases that draw on the routine data collection and the integrated demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans communities this data blind spot has been a persistent problem for many years. The lack of visibility of sexual orientation and gender identity in public health data sets was highlighted in the public health outcomes framework LGBT companion document published in 2013, and reiterated in the PHE gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, health and wellbeing framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invisibility of sexual orientation in the Census has been an area of heated debate over the last ten years, and the move by the Office for National Statistics to pilot and then roll out sexual orientation demographic data collection across the other population surveys they lead has been a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week Public Health England has published a report on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/producing-estimates-of-the-size-of-the-lgb-population-of-england&quot; title=&quot;See the report on GOV.UK&quot;&gt;modelling lesbian, gay and bisexual populations in England&lt;/a&gt;. It is a unique piece of work that builds on previous modelling done in the run up to the civil partnership legislation. PHE Rainbow Alliance members were involved in the steering group for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modelling used for this report focuses specifically on sexual orientation identity and drew on the approaches and findings from a range of different national surveys that considered sexual orientation to reach its conclusion, supported by an expert advisory group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final analysis included 15 surveys that represent the general adult population of England. The weighted estimate of people identifying as LGB or ‘other’ is 2.50%. If this proportion were applied to the census-based mid-2014 population estimate, this suggests that there would be 1,358,848 people identifying as LGB or ‘other’ in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people who responded ‘prefer not to say’, ‘don’t know’ or gave no answer are assumed to all be LGB, then the upper limit becomes 5.89%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also found the proportion of self-identified LGB is highest in men, younger age groups and mixed/multiple or other (non-White/Black/Asian) ethnic groups. Regionally, the highest prevalence was found in London, North West and North East regions with each having an overall LGB prevalence of 4.26%, 2.51% and 2.27% respectively. There are higher proportions in large cities like London (5.1%), Manchester (3.6%) and Brighton and Hove (9.9%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report was developed to provide a population dominator for organisations that have an interest in monitoring outcomes for LGB populations. It is specifically focused on the LGB population and further work is needed to include transgender and intersex people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first to systematically review existing sources and synthesize data into a new robust estimate of the size of the LGB population of England. These results should be interpreted with caution however. Not only is the result sensitive to error in each survey, but 2.50% is likely to be an underestimate as it is derived from general social surveys that did not have the specific aim of counting the LGB population. The upper limit of 5.89%, on the other hand, is almost certainly an overestimate of the included sources as it is unlikely that all non-responders are LGB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work sits alongside work being led by NHS England to improve data collection on sexual orientation in health and social care settings and the continued action led by Stonewall to improve data collection in workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PHE report is an important step forward in recognising the size of the lesbian, gay and bisexual populations and for their health outcomes and I hope it will be built upon in the future so that our communities, alongside faith, ethnicity and disabled communities are always counted and continue to count.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">Why you should volunteer to lead your LGBT network</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/02/02/why-you-should-lead-your-lgbt-network/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why you should volunteer to lead your LGBT network" />

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/02/02/why-you-should-lead-your-lgbt-network</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/02/02/why-you-should-lead-your-lgbt-network/">&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Ofcom just over a year ago, as a new starter on the graduate scheme. By the time I found out about the mythical Affinity Network for LGBT colleagues, I’d already clocked that Ofcom was a pretty gay-friendly place to work. I’d been open with all my co-workers about having a boyfriend, and had found a handful of fellow LGBT colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the fabled LGBT staff network wasn’t exactly very active. Nobody was actually running it, and the last time the network had had a committee I was still at university. It was a call for volunteers from our valiant corporate responsibility advisor, who’d kept a number of LGBT initiatives on the boil in the network’s absence, which finally got me involved. After helping to write some profiles of prominent LGBT figures in the sectors we regulate for LGBT History Month, I was asked if I might be interested in helping to rejuvenate the staff network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, we’d held open meetings for any member of staff to come along and help us brainstorm what the newly-rejuvenated Affinity Network (it’s kept the same name since it first kicked off in 2008) would actually do. With a rough list of responsibilities for the network drafted, we chose a committee to run the show. In a move I would later come to question, on the various occasions when my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; job became very hectic, I put myself forward as chair – and was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, within six months of starting at Ofcom I’d somehow managed to be put in charge of an entire (brand new) staff network. Which brings me onto my main take-home message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-reasons-why-you-should-volunteer-to-lead-your-lgbt-network&quot;&gt;Three reasons why you should volunteer to lead your LGBT network:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the chair of the Affinity Network has given me a crash course in a range of different skills: project management, chairing meetings, preparing minutes, and planning for the longer term, among others. Particularly for a new or small network, things only get done if someone volunteers to do them – so volunteers with staff networks (chairs or otherwise) will probably end up being jacks of all trades. So far we’ve resurrected the mailing list, taken papers through internal governance, organised social events and fed into staff consultations. If you’re looking to develop your career, volunteering with a staff network can be a fantastic way to take on more responsibility at work, and demonstrate skills you might not be using otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-the-rest-of-your-organisation&quot;&gt;Meet the rest of your organisation!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though, as a graduate, I move around Ofcom quite regularly, there’s no doubt that working with the network has given me the chance to meet people around the organisation I probably wouldn’t have worked with otherwise. From lawyers to economists and web designers to group directors, you’ll build up an enviable network of contacts, and help the whole organisation to be more joined-up afterwards.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-actually-really-fun&quot;&gt;It’s actually really fun!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have I had the chance to get to know my colleagues at Ofcom better, but the short time I’ve been with the network so far has also given me the chance to network with other LGBT groups, represent Ofcom externally and make new friends in other organisations’ LGBT networks.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy trying to build a staff network from scratch. There’s no manual, and everyone who’s involved is balancing the time they spend on the network with their regular jobs. But it’s also a great learning experience, and great fun – and it’s all worth it, even if it helps just one other staff member to feel comfortable enough to be themselves at work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/01/19/civil-service-agencies-excel-in-stonewall-workplace-equality-index/">&lt;p&gt;Today Stonewall has released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonewall.org.uk/get-involved/workplace/workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;the results of the 2017 Workplace Equality Index&lt;/a&gt;. The index is an annual ranking of the top 100 most LGBT-inclusive organisations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like previous years, many Civil Service organisations have submitted themselves to be part of of the index. Once again, Civil Service agencies and non-departmental bodies have excelled in the Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every agency and departmental body that featured in the Index last year has featured in it again, and many have increased their position relative to last year. GCHQ and the Scottish Government joined those agencies in the top 100 too, bringing the total number of Civil Service organisations in the Top 100 to 11, up from 9 last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office, having previously ranked in the Top 10 organisations for 3 out of 5 consecutive years, retains its Star Performer status this year too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA would like to congratulate all the organisations that have placed in the Top 100 or achieved Star Performer status.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2017/01/17/how-phe-keeps-its-lgbt-network-in-good-shape/">&lt;p&gt;Over the last three years PHE Rainbow Alliance has grown and built on the legacy and experiences of staff from the previous LGBT staff networks from the sender organisations. We have benefited from very strong and visible commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans issues in both our internal and external work from our chief executive Duncan Selbie, National Executive LGBT Champion Prof. Kevin Fenton and our Corporate Director of HR, Tony Vickers-Byrne. This support is reiterated during corporate inclusion for all staff and through our internet pages on diversity and inclusion. We also have a corporate objective to see year on year improvement in our Stonewall Equality Index ranking and score. I’m really proud that we saw significant improvements between the 2014 and 2015 scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network is supported by a small group of volunteers, and as I’m sure many others find, this can sometimes be challenging with the day job. But we have a clear organisational policy that allows staff to attend diversity networks during working time. Over the last year we have also supported line managers to agree specific objectives for some staff to support the work of PHERA and our PHERA Allies Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have staff working in over 100 different locations, mainly in England, so we have relied on CSRA’s regional networks to provide networking and engagement opportunities in areas where we only have a few members - this has really helped support people and reduce the risk of isolation. We have joined the CSRA group at London Pride as well as supporting our doctor members march with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gladd.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Association of Doctors and Dentists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also encouraged PHERA members to help influence and get involved with external PHE work. We worked with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationallgbtpartnership.org/&quot;&gt;National LGBT Health Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, to host a national LGBT health inequalities conference in 2015 and 2016. We also published some important reports and documents on LGB&amp;amp;T health issues where members have been actively involved such as; joint toolkits with the Royal College of Nursing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-suicide-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-young-people&quot;&gt;LGB&amp;amp;T youth suicide prevention&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-the-health-and-wellbeing-of-gay-bisexual-and-other-men-who-have-sex-with-men&quot;&gt;national framework for tackling health inequalities affecting gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men&lt;/a&gt;, and a suite of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationallgbtpartnership.org/publications/trans-health-factsheets/&quot;&gt;trans health living guides&lt;/a&gt; with the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHERA members have been involved in planning and supporting the Deputy Chief Medical Officer to convene a roundtable on lesbian and bisexual women’s health inequalities. PHERA and PHERA Allies members also supported work to undertake a systematic review of health inequalities affecting lesbian and bisexual women which we hope to publish next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year at the annual PHE National Conference at Warwick, PHERA hosts a breakfast roundtable chaired by our Board Champion, Professor Fenton. Last year we were joined by members from across the organisation, the third sector, public health specialists and local government leads. The roundtable is an opportunity for external and internal stakeholders to shape the thinking of PHERA for the year ahead as well as influence the wider work of PHE on LGBT health inequalities. We’ve started to build on this for our London members with monthly social lunches that bring together people on a more regular face to face basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great in 2017 to have two PHERA member’s work on diversity and inclusion celebrated at the PHE Diversity and Inclusion Awards. I was personally very honoured to be given a special award by the PHE board for my contribution to promoting staff diversity and inclusion since the formation of PHE. The award highlighted my work with PHERA and how we are practicing what we preach internally as well as promoting inclusion externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead we aim to strengthen the capacity within the organisation to support PHERA, provide more opportunities for staff to network and engage with each other and continue to work towards an even higher rating in the Stonewall Equality Index!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<title type="html">Why I declare my diversity</title>
			<link href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/09/19/emily-miles-why-i-declare-my-diversity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I declare my diversity" />
			<published>2016-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</published>
			<updated>2016-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/09/19/emily-miles-why-i-declare-my-diversity</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/09/19/emily-miles-why-i-declare-my-diversity/">&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, whenever I’m asked to tick a box on diversity data, I declare that I’m bisexual. It only comes up when I’m filling out the diversity monitoring form for a job application, or filling out the annual staff survey – or registering in a new department, as I recently have done on the HR system in Defra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine most people assume I’m heterosexual. I’m very happily married to my husband, Paul, and we have two children. My bisexuality is, I used to think, nothing to do with the people I work with. I don’t particularly want to be speculated about or judged. But I had a painful experience which now makes me wish others before me had been more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bisexual was only something I really started owning up to – even to myself – after I’d been a civil servant for some time. I thought that being bisexual was not welcome in the upper echelons of the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in my career, I had been developed vetted, the highest form of security clearance – which most permanent secretaries need, and anyone who works in Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long, three hour interview, conducted by a retired male police officer working for the Foreign Office. We sat in an airless basement room somewhere around Horseguards. He went through my bank statements, asked me what I’d got up to at university and asked whether I had any ‘lesbian or other deviant tendencies’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was in the early 2000s. I knew in my head that gay people were successfully developed vetted. I knew that it was inappropriate that he had framed his question in that way. But I didn’t make a fuss. I got my security clearance. But later, acknowledging my bisexuality, I started avoiding jobs that required my developed vetting to be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few years, I got to the point of renewing my ordinary security clearance. There was a bit at the end of the form that asked me to declare anything else that might be significant. It led to a couple of sleepless nights. If I did not declare that I was bisexual, would I live with myself for lying? Were people like me allowed in the senior civil service? Might I lose my job? Would they think I had lied before, when I hadn’t even been out to myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t aware of any other bisexual people who were in the senior civil service, and the last time I’d looked at my department’s diversity data, the statistics suggested that there was just one – and I knew that was me, as I’d ticked the box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagined that other bisexual people had been like me, believing it wasn’t their workplace’s business. They hadn’t declared their sexuality on the diversity forms, and they hadn’t reported the odd bit of discriminatory language. But because I had been quiet, and they had been quiet before me, someone had allowed that silly question to be asked in the developed vetting interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this blog led me to contact the Cabinet Office about vetting policy. They say that nowadays, sexual behaviour is treated more maturely and sensitively in the developed vetting process. They are very keen to encourage LGBT people to go through vetting. Every vetting officer receives diversity training. Complaints about the vetting process are treated very seriously. And this year, the whole system is being revamped with a greater emphasis on customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, MI5 was just named by Stonewall as its top employer of the year for 2015, ahead of Lloyds Bank and Cardiff University. But I strongly suspect that it took people speaking up, and even ticking boxes, to get things changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care passionately about having a diverse Civil Service. This isn’t just about sexuality. It’s about all of us. We can’t be good policy makers, and we can’t deliver good services, if we assume our perspective is the only one going. The reason why we all need to know the numbers on diversity characteristics – on sexuality, on disability, on ethnicity – is that sometimes it’s only the hard facts that can help create the case for change. My story also shows that the facts reassure people that they are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have a plea. Declaring your sexuality, your disability, or your ethnicity on a confidential form is much easier than what I’m doing right now in this blog. The data in that checkbox can’t be disaggregated and identified back to individuals on the Defra HR system. I’m saying this particularly for those whose diversity characteristic is hidden, like mental health, a hidden disability like dyslexia, or sexuality. Ticking that box is a way of reaching out and saying, ‘You are not alone’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were thrilled to be joined by 3 permanent secretaries at the parade this year: Richard Heaton (Ministry of Justice), Sue Owen (Department for Culture, Media and Sport) and Clare Moriarty (Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having support from 3 of the Civil Service’s most senior leaders is really important. When people see their leaders championing difference, they feel comfortable being themselves and challenging the barriers put in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Give it up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OurCivilService?src=hash&quot;&gt;#OurCivilService&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrideInLondon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#PrideInLondon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoFilter?src=hash&quot;&gt;#NoFilter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeYourself?src=hash&quot;&gt;#BeYourself&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m7H2IpKbTY&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m7H2IpKbTY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AGC2gwYlCi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AGC2gwYlCi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CSRA (@UKCSRA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCSRA/status/746733522501640192&quot;&gt;June 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20,000 people working in the Civil Service are LGBT; we want them to be able to feel safe and proud at work so they can give their all and get the most from their career in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why this year we adopted a theme: #BeYourself. We want to encourage everyone to create a Civil Service that champions difference so everyone can be themselves at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/132635591@N02/27658394850/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Civil Service at Pride 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7316/27658394850_981829b2e9_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; alt=&quot;Civil Service at Pride 2016&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2016/06/28/be-yourself-this-pride-and-champion-difference/&quot;&gt;a blog post on GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, Sue Owen, the Civil Service LGBTI &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/tag/diversity-champions/&quot;&gt;Diversity Champion&lt;/a&gt;, reminded us that we have a lot to be Proud of as a Civil Service too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Civil Service has a lot to be proud of in driving that progress forward. The work we do every day has an impact on the lives of millions of people across the country. The decriminalisation of homosexuality, equal marriage rights, the Equalities Act: none of these would have happened if it weren’t for the tireless efforts of civil servants. We’re not often in the limelight, but we are the reason our country is seen as great country for LGBTI people to live, love and work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is time to reflect on how far we’ve come, but also how far we have to go. We marched to show that the Civil Service is a diverse and inclusive employer; and that we need to continue to be that, because if we don’t invite a diversity of opinion, we won’t deliver for the public we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The message from today: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeYourself?src=hash&quot;&gt;#BeYourself&lt;/a&gt; and love one another. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5GMFion2AU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5GMFion2AU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CSRA (@UKCSRA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCSRA/status/746754592873000960&quot;&gt;June 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-took-lots-of-photos&quot;&gt;We took lots of photos&lt;/h2&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/27/kris-mckeown-if-you-cannot-be-yourself-at-work-you-cannot-be-yourself-at-all/">&lt;p&gt;I have always been a believer in the notion that you do not have to be part of a particular gender, race, religion or sexuality in order to have empathy and affinity with those who are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I am of the belief that you do not have to be part of a group to be offended, upset by and want to challenge abuse or ill-treatment of that particular group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to express those beliefs and attempt to put them to practical use rather than simply being internal feelings. I feel I have a duty as someone who is in a majority group to support people who are in the minority, rather simply paying lip service to my stance on these issues. This is not through any guilt or privilege, but from a moral purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a more personal perspective, this is why I wanted to be an LGBTI Ally when the opportunity presented itself to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ex-colleague of mine, a gay man, was once subject to a homophobic remark from a Line Manager. He was very upset by it and I was shocked at what was said to him, especially from someone in a position of authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that because of the remark that was made and the attitude expressed by a higher grade, that he would always feel like one of ‘them’ (outwith the team) as opposed to one of ‘us’ (within the team). I considered the notion of being considered second class or inferior because of one aspect of my life, my sexuality and the thought was horrendous. This feeling never left me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot be yourself at work, you cannot fully be yourself at all. If I can only ever make just one person never feel like my ex-colleague, then being an Ally will have been utterly worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/24/aaron-booth-ive-never-felt-like-i-had-to-hide-who-i-am/">&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I am proud to work for the Civil Service is because I’ve never felt like I had to hide who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is important because unlike a lot of other employers there is an acceptance and even sometimes an expectation that you will move between many different roles over your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked in the Civil Service for just under 3 years and I am currently in my 4th role, having worked in two different departments. I consider myself lucky to work for such an inclusive employer; moving between roles and offices can be daunting, even at the best of times but it’s been easier as a civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important for everyone to be comfortable to be themselves at work, quite frankly, because you spend so much time in the office. Hiding who you are and creating ‘micro-lies’ to cover up your sexuality takes up a lot of time and effort that could be spent elsewhere. Not to mention the stress you would be under juggling both your work and the lies you have to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone on the Fast Stream programme, I’m expected to change job roles every 6 months; I have to introduce myself to a new set of colleagues fairly often. While I am totally comfortable with talking about my partner and sharing who I am, I know of other colleagues who decide to just keep it under their hat since they may only be in a job role for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events like Pride are important to normalise being LGBT in society. Every LGBT person can empathise with that tension you sometimes feel when you’re with your partner in public. It may be because you have just kissed and you’re having a quick look round to make sure nobody is disgusted, or it may be a group of young lads who have gotten onto the bus or tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the attack in Orlando it is clear we still have a long way to go in society to normalise being LGBT, but I am proud of the progress that the Civil Service has made to normalise being LGBT in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first joined work and understood what processes were in place to protect me, I was so surprised at the difference in attitudes from somewhere like school where I had left not long prior. In school a homophobic comment, slur or even an attack would be treated with a slap on the wrist while I am so proud to know that in the Civil Service you are much more protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules that are in place, and the broader work in the Civil Service through CSRA and campaigns like &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/01/role-models-inspiring-lgb-people-in-the-civil-service/&quot;&gt;Role Models&lt;/a&gt; allow me to be comfortable with being who I am in the workplace and I would like to send a message to everyone that I hope you can feel comfortable being yourself in work, in Public and at Pride as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/23/warren-hallett-the-home-office-gave-me-my-life-back</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/23/warren-hallett-the-home-office-gave-me-my-life-back/">&lt;p&gt;I joined the Home Office in 2003. At the interview, I was asked about the motivations for applying. “Because the Home Office gave me my life back, and I can now be myself without fear of being persecuted.” I replied. “I want to give something back to the UK for giving me my life back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993, I was a 3rd year student at Edinburgh University – fully funded by the government of my birth country. I was an ‘A’ grade student; one of thirty who had won a prestigious scholarship to study in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One evening, I met a fellow country man in a bar. Up to that point I thought I was the only gay man from my birth country studying in Edinburgh. Feeling excited, I naively told him everything about me. Unbeknown to me, he was married – as homosexuality is illegal back home, it is not uncommon for gay men to lead a double life to avoid the Authority’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse still, unbeknown to me, he outed me by sending a damning letter to the grant-awarding department (that paid my scholarship) and to my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the point when everything in my life was turned upside down. My scholarship got terminated because ‘the government does not fund LGBT students’; I got kicked out of university; my parents disowned me; my boyfriend left me because he could not cope with me being depressed. I’d never felt so alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being left penniless for three months, I received a letter from the government of my birth country summoning me to go home and stand trial – for being gay – for being myself. I tore the letter up and went into hiding. A close friend advised me to claim asylum. I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between then and 2000 when I got granted refugee status - and British citizenship shortly after - my life was like one big roller coaster ride. I often refer to it as the ‘dark period’. I was deeply ashamed of my immigration status. I often pretended I was someone else. Introducing yourself as an asylum seeker to a date or someone you fancy at a gay bar is just not a cool thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career at the Home Office, I’ve never had to hide my sexuality. Colleagues and line managers have been incredibly supportive and welcoming – and I’ve often been described as a positive happy person. By being myself and out at work, I feel that I’m able to help strengthen diversity awareness among colleagues and form honest relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I am happy to be open about my sexuality at work, I’ve never really shared my experiences as a refugee with colleagues… until a few months ago. I agreed for playwright Clare Summerskill to turn the ‘dark period’ of my life into a play. It’s called ‘Rights of Passage’. Aside from raising awareness of LGBT and asylum issues, my hope is that the play would let others going through the same experience realise they’re not alone. I invited colleagues to the play in May this year. It was like ‘coming out’ for the second time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most certainly have come a long way. Sometimes I have to stop and pinch myself. I no longer feel ashamed and embarrassed, or sorry for myself. These feelings have been replaced with immense pride. My utmost gratitude goes to the Home Office and the UK for not only giving back my life, they also gave me the chance to live with dignity, hope and respect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/22/ben-reardon-everyone-works-better-when-they-can-be-themselves/">&lt;p&gt;Being yourself should be the easiest thing in the world to do, right? I mean; it’s &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;! You know who you are. You know how you feel. You know how to be. You are you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is that lucky. There are still people out there that don’t feel like they can be themselves because they are constantly questioning what that actually is. Gender identity and sexual orientation are two of many factors that can cause us to question who we are; but they can also be considered taboo topics which leads to internalised anxiety and distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil servants in particular need to be able to be themselves at work. Civil servants are public servants. We work for the public and - as a workforce - we should be representative of the wider public too. As an LGBT civil servant, if you feel uncomfortable with yourself at such a core level, that will inevitably have a negative impact on your work, let alone your wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working at Natural Resources Wales for over a year now. In that time, I’ve come into contact with hundreds of different members of staff and thousands of people throughout Wales and the rest of the UK. Initially, I was so scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if my colleagues judge me because I mention I have a boyfriend in conversation? 
What if a customer gives me abuse because of the way in which I speak over the phone? 
What if my manager doesn’t listen to what I’m saying because they disapprove of my ‘lifestyle choice’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I’ve never come across any of these actual situations in my role but the fear was still there and definitely real. That’s where my local LGBT network came in. Knowing that there was a well-founded group of proud colleagues throughout the organisation and even more straight allies was a massive comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a civil servant, my ability to deal with my work has a direct effect on the people of this country. If I can’t be myself and if others in my organisation and other organisations couldn’t be themselves either, we wouldn’t have the confidence to answer the phone, speak to colleagues or even turn up to work at all. The reality is everyone works better when they can be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been here for a year now and it is with thanks to the culture of Natural Resources Wales that I plan on staying here for many more years to come, helping the people of Wales confidently in every way my role entails.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/21/kylie-mulholland-our-community-is-very-sociable-relaxed-friendly-and-fun/">&lt;p&gt;With summer stretching out ahead of us and the days getting longer and hotter, it can only mean that Pride season is almost here! I’ve been to London Pride in recent years and love the atmosphere of celebration. It’s always a brilliant fun and the after parties in Soho are not to be missed. The creeping &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/06/conversation-pride-gay-rights-party&quot;&gt;shadow of commercialisation&lt;/a&gt; has put off some people I know, but I’m hopeful that the true spirit of activism continues to shine through and the event can retain its relevance. This year I’m heading to the biggest UK Pride festival in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brighton-pride.org/&quot;&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, and am really looking forward to checking out the scene in this famously diverse and gay friendly city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked and saddened to hear of the recent targeted attacks on the LGBT community in Orlando, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/sky-news-homophobia-orlando-sexuality&quot;&gt;worst targeted mass killing of LGBT people since the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. More than ever this is a time for us and our heterosexual allies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/London-stands-with-Orlando-1914866975318453&quot;&gt;stand together&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnpe.art/2016/06/14/to-my-heterosexual-friends-orlando-shootings&quot;&gt;be defiant&lt;/a&gt;, and to lend our support in solidarity and protest against such hate crimes. Pride this year will feel especially emotional in light of this atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to Pride for me is also about showing solidarity with under-represented communities, many of whom do not receive the support and protection afforded to others. Whilst attitudes to sexuality have progressed positively in recent years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; is only just starting to be talked about and understood in the public space. To present a non cis-gender identity outwith the traditional binaries is still hugely difficult despite increasing prominence in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/04/same-sex-relationships-gender-fluid-queer-kristen-stewart&quot;&gt;mainstream media&lt;/a&gt;. The recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/women-and-equalities-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/transgender-equality/&quot;&gt;transgender equality report&lt;/a&gt; represents an important step for transgender rights, at the very least recognising some of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My role is in one of the digital delivery teams in the Ministry of Justice. We’re fortunate to have many incredible LGBTQ* role models in the digital and technology space. Last year’s Pride perfectly coincided with the United States ruling that denial of marriage to same-sex couples was unconstitutional. The lead plaintiff on the landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor&quot;&gt;civil rights case&lt;/a&gt; that led to this decision was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Windsor&quot;&gt;Edie Windsor&lt;/a&gt;; one of the first female senior systems programmers at IBM who reached the highest level technical position at the company. Edie is heavily involved in LGBT activism, publicly participating in marches and events such as Pride, and is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesbianswhotech.org/&quot;&gt;Lesbians Who Tech&lt;/a&gt; community who run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lesbianswhotech/the-lesbians-who-techs-edie-windsor-coding-scholar/posts/1554959&quot;&gt;Edie Windsor scholarship programme&lt;/a&gt; supporting LGBTQ* women to learn how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active participation in the LGBTQ* community doesn’t need to be purely extra-curricular. By being ourselves at work and fostering an inclusive environment, we can provide the opportunity for other LGBTQ* employees to reach out if they need support. Employers who foster inclusive environments where it’s safe for LGBT employees to be honest about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity enjoy higher retention rates and more productive teams amongst &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enei.org.uk/pages/the-business-case-for-diversity-.html&quot;&gt;many other benefits&lt;/a&gt;. I’m pleased to see our Permanent Secretary Richard Heaton &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/27/sir-jeremy-heywood/&quot;&gt;taking pride in difference&lt;/a&gt; across the Ministry of Justice and the wider Civil Service. We believe the Department is better for it, and that’s why we’re starting to setup a LGBTQ* community for colleagues in Digital and Technology across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our community is very sociable, relaxed, friendly, and (we think) fun. We don’t have an agenda or set objectives; it’s about getting to know colleagues we wouldn’t meet otherwise. Members have told us they feel more empowered and confident to talk about issues with people who may have gone through similar, without having to go through a more serious or formal forum. The group is organic, rather than prescribed, and we’re always looking to extend the invite across other digital and technology teams across government. So far we have members from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bisdigital.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Business Innovation and Skills&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Government Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitaltrade.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;UK Trade and Investment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in the digital or technology space and are interested in coming along to our next drinks, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kylie.mulholland@digital.justice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll hook you up with an invite!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/06/20/lucy-swannell-pride-is-a-great-way-to-celebrate/">&lt;p&gt;I used to go to Pride as a teenager in London with my sister who is gay. It used to be in our local park in South London, Brockwell Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a thrill seeing Norwood Road suddenly transformed and full of colourful, vibrant and openly gay people completely outnumbering any lads who might be homophobic. It was also heartening to see that there were many more people like my sister, celebrating who they were and getting strength from the pride of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years have passed since then and, although there has been a lot of progress in achieving equality for those who are LGBT through legislation, I know that my sister still doesn’t feel able to express herself as freely as I can. Until she feels comfortable to give her girlfriend a kiss and cuddle outside of their home, there is still more to be done in terms of society being and feeling more equal and accepting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days I attend Pride in a more sober capacity, to work on the stand and promote the work of my employer, Natural Resources Wales. I am an Ally Champion on its LGBT network which has taken many positive steps to show that promoting equality is not just a legal requirement, but an organisational priority and this reassures staff they can be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride events in the UK also give hope and show solidarity with other countries where there is still much to be done. It scares me that if my sister had been born in Uganda for example, her life would be so much more difficult and possibly endangered and it is terrible that all over the globe people are being criminalised and punished for how they love. I didn’t choose to be heterosexual so how could anyone else be expected to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote from one my favourite people, Quentin Crisp, sums up my feelings perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think you can really be proud of being gay because it isn’t something you’ve done. You can only be proud of not being ashamed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is a great way to celebrate not being ashamed and I’ll always support it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/05/20/celebrating-idahot-nathaniel-dale-my-team-have-made-me-feel-extremely-comfortable/">&lt;p&gt;“Aren’t you going to get AIDS?” The question was asked by an 11-year-old as I walked from one school class to another. I was 14 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you have to make things so difficult for yourself?” That’s what my mother asked me when I showed her my acceptance letter for college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why can’t I find someone so I can have kids!?” demanded my sister. “You’re never going to have them anyway because you’re a lesbian,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a lesbian. I was bisexual. I am now a gay man. When you explore and experience so many identities, you find similarities between them. The biggest similarity between every stage of my life is that I have always encountered a term that is described as a ‘phobia’ -  whether homophobia, transphobia or biphobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is IDAHOT – an International Day of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. It helps people understand what people like me are faced with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that acts of hatred are not a ‘fear.’ However, I believe that the negativity that stems from such acts is the irrational fear of the unknown - of change - of deep-rooted issues that still remain in society such as misogyny (which is a large basis for homophobia and transphobia). When people are overwhelmed with this irrationality, they are likely to lash out at the things that most concern them in a way to protect themselves. Not that this ever makes such behaviour acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every step, I have had to stop my journey abruptly as I faced a wall of hate. Ever since I was 13 years-old and a rumour of my sexuality spread like wildfire across my school, I could not go a single day without being asked inappropriate question after inappropriate question. I was screamed at, belittled, punched, spat at. The world was saying to me: “This is how you deserve to be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was brave enough at college to start undergoing transition as a transgender man, I had a hope that things would somehow be easier despite the challenges that I would face. What I found was that people’s attitudes could be far more damaging and terrifying than any doctor’s appointment or surgical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I reached a point where my anxiety and depression became so crippling that I was incapable of working. I was pretty much incapable of everything. I could hardly leave the house and felt nothing but intense hatred for myself because the people around me had never shown me anything to suggest that I wasn’t some kind of offensively horrific deviant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had fought so hard to be myself, and yet I kept that person locked away. I even have a tattoo on my forearm of a keyhole and an anatomical heart. I couldn’t let anyone in. I couldn’t let anyone truly see me even when I had done so much to be true to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last spring, I lost my house, and with that I lost everything. I was forced to take shelter with one of my sisters in Northamptonshire and start life all over again from the very beginning. At 27 years-old I had no work experience, a mixed bag of grades from school and was a two-time college drop out. But that sudden kick to the system made me realise: “Why am I worried about other people instead of living for myself?” I got thrown into the world and I embraced it. For the first time, the world started embracing me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did four volunteer jobs, enrolled in two classes, overcame my fear of public transport, and  started to look after myself. What shocked me was that everywhere I went, no-one batted an eyelid. I even spoke about the fact that I was gay to a teenage girl who volunteered alongside me in a charity shop. I expected her to be repulsed like people her age were when I was at school. But all she showed me was acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when I was offered a job working for the Combined Court in Northampton with the Ministry of Justice. I had almost written myself off entirely, yet here I was. One of the first things I noticed in this job was the well-written e-learning courses on Diversity and I was utterly shocked. They used correct terms, correct pronouns, they were modern, friendly and easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that knowledge, I asked my manager if I could lead a TIB during February to do something a little different and speak to the team about LGBT History Month. I prepared a bunch of facts and tried my best not to have a panic attack when I delivered them, but everyone was absolutely delightful. They listened and they acknowledged what I had to say, and there wasn’t a single drop of criticism. Any concerns I had about them treating me differently from then on turned out to be completely unfounded!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then more recently, I happened to be leading the TIB on the International Day of Transgender Awareness. As a completely spur of the moment act of spontaneity I ended the TIB with, “So in recognition of that, uhh… I am transgender. So! Now you all… know that.” And then practically ran away, shaking like a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-one said a thing. What they did do, however, was treat me exactly the same. If anything, it almost felt like everyone was a little more approachable towards me after that, probably as a result of me breaking down a barrier that I myself had created in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experiences working with MoJ have been nothing but positive and it has had a huge impact on my daily wellbeing. I work with an amazing team of kind, intelligent individuals who have never once even begun to show any sign of judgement. From day one they have made me feel extremely comfortable, and that has also been reflected in the management and their support of my ongoing gender transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that days like IDAHOT continue to spread awareness of the problems that people are being forced to face, so that the world can be more like what is happening here at Northampton Combined Court.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/29/oliver-entwistle-lets-make-history-month-a-catalyst-for-change-in-the-civil-service/">&lt;p&gt;Over the last month we’ve been celebrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://lgbthistorymonth.org.uk&quot;&gt;LGBT History&lt;/a&gt; Month across the Civil Service and we’ve been telling the story of why the month is so important to our members. For me, this year’s theme of religion, belief and faith has a personal significance. As an openly gay Christian, I have first-hand experience of the prejudice that still exists between communities. I’ve experienced the good, the bad and the ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be heavily involved in a central London Catholic Church, where I was the Master of Ceremonies and assistant organist. But that ended when some of the parishioners found out that I was gay. What followed was a torrid couple of months that started a whispering campaign. All sorts of allegations were made. The most lurid being that I was having it away with the Priests (&lt;em&gt;as if!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day this gossiping took a sinister turn when a parishioner confronted me. She was shouting all sorts at me. Telling me that I was going to “burn in hell”. I tried to walk away from her but she grabbed me and then, having obviously wound herself up a fever pitch, struck me across the face. I couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to call the police but was talked out of that by the Priest. Instead a series of meetings were arranged with the aim of a reconciliation occurring. It was a partial success. I received an apology from her but it was clear that she, and her fellow parishioners, would never be comfortable with a young gay man playing an active role in the parish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of trying to stick it out, I left. I didn’t go to church regularly for a few years after that. 
This was the ugly side of prejudice in the Church. Many people, including my Christian friends, don’t know this story. I don’t really like to talk about it, but my experience of being a gay Christian is not all negative. I’ve also experienced the good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I did start going to church again, I went to a different parish where the parishioners were much more liberal and open minded. I felt welcome there and became the organist there for many years before I moved out of the area. The choir members also met my partner on several occasions and they were very welcoming to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think part of the reason for this change in my experience of the church is down to the changes in society’s view of LGBT people in the past decade or so. I think this has made many people, including church goers, much more open-minded. I also think it is down to the increased dialogue between different groups over the years that have promoted understanding and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need these conversations to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still widespread homophobia in religious communities across the world. There is also fear and distrust of religion within large sections of the LGBT community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a large employer in the UK, the Civil Service does have a role to play in this dialogue. I am not saying that we should be getting into theological debates but the different diversity networks in the Civil Service can bring their members together to share experiences and best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, in late 2015, I helped to establish a forum for all the cross-departmental networks. We use this forum to talk about what matters to each network in the Civil Service, to explore where we have common ground on diversity policy, and to share ideas and events. It would be great if this could be a catalyst for progress across the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is important because, at the end of the day, most people have more than one protected characteristic. There are many civil servants who identify as BAME and LGB, trans and LGB,  or female and lesbian, for example. Yet we do not fully understand what it’s like to be one of those people in the Civil Service. Through dialogue, we can change this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s use this year’s history month theme to be a catalyst for change. Let’s work together to ensure that the Civil Service is the place where you can bring your whole-self to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/29/julie-pope-the-essence-of-staff-networks-will-always-be-the-people/">&lt;p&gt;I’m a writer in my spare time, so stories are important to me. My characters have voices that want to be heard, a tale to tell and a message to convey. My LGBT activism is much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work to make sure that those with perhaps not the loudest voices, or those who are reluctant to come forward, are still counted and valued, and have their stories told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the Inland Revenue in September 2000. Back then there wasn’t much in the way of LGBT support. When, the department merged with Customs and Excise and became HM Revenue and Customs in 2006, there was a new energy to support LGBT staff and things  have been getting better ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, our network is active and pushing for an evermore inclusive workplace. We regularly consult with LGBT staff and network members across HMRC, and we make positive changes to the way the department works led by their needs. We wouldn’t be the inclusive employer we are today without the work of LGBT staff as part of this network over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m mightily proud of the progress we’ve made. I’m particularly proud that we’ve been recognised for that progress. Over the last 10 years, HMRC has featured prominently in the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index Top 100; and in 2010 we were recognised as the 8th most inclusive employer in the country. Of course, even with this progress, there is still much to be done, both in my own department and the wider Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Service has supported great progress on the legal rights of LGBT people, but attitude and cultural changes take far longer. LGBT History Month for me is not about the well-known pioneers of change; it’s about the ordinary folk who turn up for work each morning and talk openly about their same sex partner, and who are unapologetically themselves in the workplace. Their stories inspire others by osmosis. You can’t legislate to fix culture, but you can be a role model in your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of staff networks will always be the people. Our unique stories of self-discovery and coming out, of falling in and out of love and of how we pull together in the face of adversity inspire others. I’ve made so many friends and contacts across the UK from my work with the HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs LGBT Network. I’ve been exposed to a plethora of people and their stories and have become a richer person because of it. I still have much to learn, more people to meet and more stories to hear.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/26/john-peart-i-couldnt-be-more-comfortable-being-out-where-i-work/">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;What did you do last night?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those 6 words can be really stressful to an LGBT person. It sounds silly, but when you’re not ‘out’ at work, being asked such a simple question can turn into a minefield of lies and misdirection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re hiding your sexuality at work, answering personal questions about what you do &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; work can take up a lot of brain-space. It’s easy to remember what you were &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doing, but remembering what you &lt;em&gt;made up&lt;/em&gt; you were doing so people don’t suspect you’re gay can be a real chore. That’s why it’s so important to make workplaces open and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky; I couldn’t be more comfortable being out where I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the Civil Service in 2013 after starting the Digital and Technology Fast Stream. Currently, I’m in the Cabinet Office, working at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Government Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s surprised me about GDS in particular is how easy it was to be out and open about my sexuality. In part, I think that’s because there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2016/02/19/stephen-foreshew-cain-civil-servants-have-been-at-the-forefront-of-equality-work/&quot;&gt;visible LGBT senior role models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of our senior civil service are out and that helps to set the tone for the entire organisation. It means that — unlike other places I’ve worked — no one I’ve spoken to has experienced LGBT discrimination at work since they joined GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LGBT staff, we have the support of the entire organisation - from the top, all the way down. Our leaders have supported us in setting up an LGBT network; and we have straight allies all over GDS that take an active interest in LGBT issues. It’s this kind of support that makes it easy to be out at work; and because I don’t have to worry about hiding myself from my colleagues, I can get on with putting my whole-self into my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t  give 100% at work when you’re distracted with inventing a second life to hide behind. Creating an inclusive work environment for LGBT people is essential to creating a motivated and productive team. That’s why I’m so lucky to work at a place like GDS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/24/gavin-thomas-we-wanted-to-ensure-lgbt-colleagues-are-supported-and-encouraged/">&lt;p&gt;I work at Ofsted. We inspect and regulate services that care for children and young people, and services providing education and skills for learners of all ages. I focus on social care for my job. I also help to run our department’s LGBT network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December, we launched the ‘Ambassadors’ programme. The ‘Ambassadors’ programme is an outreach support scheme for LGBT staff who work for Ofsted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambassadors are named individuals across the organisation that provide an informal and friendly support service for all LGBT staff. They help to make Ofsted a safe and positive work environment for all our staff who identify with as part of a sexual orientation or gender identity minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofsted’s workforce is very diverse and geographically spread-out – a lot of our staff spend most of their time doing visits to schools or care providers. We’ve had to think carefully about how we make the scheme work for everyone – whether they are office-based, home-based or field-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up this scheme was really important to me and others in Ofsted. We wanted to ensure that colleagues who identify as LGBT were supported and encouraged to be themselves. I’ve found support networks like this really useful to me in the past, so it’s really exciting to see us successfully introducing it at Ofsted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want our Ambassadors scheme to help reduce isolation and increase awareness of LGBT staff and issues in Ofsted. It also helps us to raise awareness of other networks and support services in the Civil Service, like CSRA and a:gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that by making LGBT people more visible and supporting them in this way that more people will feel comfortable being out at Ofsted and can bring their whole-selves to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/22/brais-louro-workplace-equality-is-the-responsibility-of-all-civil-servants/">&lt;p&gt;I’m the kind of person who would only work in a place where I feel welcomed as a gay man. I don’t think that’s too much to ask, and I’m very happy to say that is exactly how I feel in the Civil Service. I joined in 2013, and I immediately felt welcomed into a more diverse workforce than any I had worked in before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, I have noticed there’s a collective understanding that diversity is not just about bringing people from different backgrounds together, but about creating an inclusive environment where everyone can realise their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My teammates – first in the Department of Energy and Climate Change and now Public Health England – have been actively supportive and championed any activities I or other colleagues organised as part of my departmental networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My managers have encouraged me to increase my visibility as a gay man and develop my skills as a as an LGB* leader. I attended the Stonewall Leadership Programme with their support; it helped me reflect on my responsibility as an LGB* leader and bring the revamped energy back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everyone has the same experience, and workplace inclusion is not just a responsibility of LGB* or any other ‘minority’ groups; it’s the responsibility of all civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just me who says this; our most senior leaders agree. Sir Jeremy Heywood was clear in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/28/where-were-going-with-diversity-and-inclusion/&quot;&gt;recent blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  “We need to ensure that the changes in policy are accompanied by changes in culture throughout the Civil Service. And that means all of us looking at what we can do to make ourselves and the teams we work in more inclusive, so that we are not simply ticking the ‘diversity’ box but are actually becoming an organisation that genuinely values difference not conformity.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest question for me is how we go about creating this “more inclusive” environment. I don’t think there is one answer, but I do know that it will require everyone in the Civil Service to pitch in, and I believe it has to start with a more inclusive dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how many of you would have been through a similar situation, but when conversations get personal, the starting assumption still is ‘you must be heterosexual’. And it does get awkward, leading to silence or on occasion a “well… erm… I don’t have a girlfriend…actually I don’t think I’d ever have one… erm…” Lots of blushing usually follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption is right most of the time, but when it’s wrong, it can make LGB* people feel uncomfortable and less welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing our culture is tricky, but we have to do it. There isn’t only a strong moral case, but also a solid business one too. For example, when gay people remain in the closet they are 10 per cent less productive than when they feel able to be themselves &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We have enough of a productivity puzzle, so it’s in our collective interest to fix what we can fix, and I believe we can fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call on all civil servants to act. You don’t have to know all there is to know about diversity or inclusion to be an ally – believe in equal treatment and agree that it is our collective responsibility to create an inclusive work space. And know this: you will have a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/19/stephen-foreshew-cain-civil-servants-have-been-at-the-forefront-of-equality-work/">&lt;p&gt;This month is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/&quot;&gt;LGBT History Month&lt;/a&gt;. LGBT History Month happens each year in February. It’s a chance to reflect on the positive contributions that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people make to our society, and to promote diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme this year for LGBT History month is “religion, belief and faith”. It’s a great theme to highlight. It reminds me that despite our differences – whether they be of faith or sexuality, race, gender or background – our diversity makes us stronger. That’s evident through the progress we’ve made as a country and as a Civil Service over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s theme is intensely personal for me. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2014/jul/11/vicar-wedding-same-sex-marriage-rev-andrew-cain&quot;&gt;married my husband&lt;/a&gt;, an incredibly dedicated and caring parish priest, a year and a half ago. As the Church of England’s official stance on our marriage is less than Christian I think I could be forgiven for despairing of the role of religion in my life. But I don’t despair. His congregation and the wider network of &lt;a href=&quot;http://inclusive-church.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Inclusive Churches&lt;/a&gt; (who believe in a church which does not discriminate, on any level) have been amazingly supportive. Although not religious myself, their generosity and welcome have restored my faith in people of faith. It also makes me thankful to work in an organisation where diversity and inclusion is valued and indeed championed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t forget to celebrate that the UK has come a long way on LGBT equality; and civil servants have been at the forefront of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, we’ve supported the introduction of marriage equality legislation, ensured fair treatment in the workplace and in the sale of goods and services, and much more. We are some of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2016/01/21/civil-service-among-the-best/&quot;&gt;open and inclusive organisations in the country&lt;/a&gt; for LGBT staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cabinet Office SCS LGBT Diversity Champion, helping to make the Civil Service one of the most inclusive and diverse organisations in government is something I care passionately about; and I know that sentiment is shared at every level of the Civil Service. Improving diversity is something we’re actively discussing in the Cabinet Office, building on the excellent work we already do as a department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to particularly highlight the great work our diversity networks do at times like this. This year, members of the Cabinet Office LGBT network have done a great job in leading our bid to Stonewall for the Workplace Equality Index. Their hard work is making Cabinet Office a better place to work for LGBT people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For LGBT History Month, the Cabinet Office network is running a lecture on ‘Religion, Belief and Philosophy’, together with Parliament’s network, ParliOUT. It’s on 26 February at 18:00 – 19:30. If you’d like to attend, please register on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lgbt-history-month-talk-religion-belief-and-philosophy-tickets-20913920098&quot;&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/17/charlotte-jackson-i-will-continue-to-champion-difference/">&lt;p&gt;As an ‘out’ lesbian, I often get asked “when did you first realise you were…?”. That question invariably sets in motion a recollection of first crushes and childhood role models (&lt;em&gt;thank you Belinda Carlisle and Calamity Jane&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a community, I think we do a lot of reflecting, both in terms of key moments in our personal history - like when we come out - and in terms of those people who influenced us and shaped our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel indebted to those who pushed themselves to the forefront and put themselves on the line to champion equality, and expose bigotry and hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Milk&quot;&gt;Harvey Milk&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first openly gay elected officials who symbolised the freedom to live life with authenticity to millions of LGBT women and men around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Windsor&quot;&gt;Edie Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, who at the age of 81 made history after challenging the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned the federal recognition of same-sex marriages and the benefits they were entitled to – benefits she was denied when her partner of almost 50 years passed away and she was left with a huge inheritance tax bill because federal law did not recognise the validity of their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tatchell&quot;&gt;Peter Tatchell&lt;/a&gt;, the human rights and LGBT activist, whose determination to claim justice for the oppressed and the powerless, regardless of personal safety and without ever compromising his principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength and tenacity of those people - and countless others - has inspired me to be a better leader in championing LGBT issues in the workplace. I’ve realised that even though every day it becomes a little bit easier for people to be open and authentic at work, there are still those who feel isolated and afraid to be their true self. Whilst that is still the case, I will continue to put myself at the forefront to speak on their behalf; to challenge where it is needed; to champion equality; and to celebrate difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked in both the private and public sector. When it comes to being LGBT, the Civil Service is definitely the most welcoming and forward-thinking place to be out at work I’ve been in. This is not saying I was never out before - given that I’m prone to &lt;em&gt;bravado&lt;/em&gt; being ‘in’ was never really an option - but I feel like the Civil Service is the first place where my difference has been actively championed and encouraged in terms of sharing my knowledge and telling my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I take such an enthusiastic and active role in chairing our own LGBT network in the Ministry of Justice - SPIRIT - and why I got involved with CSRA as women’s officer. As well as the sense of solidarity it gives me and the great friendships I’ve made, I want to part of creating a  Civil Service culture where all people feel comfortable in seeking support, making new connections and sharing their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in answer to the question at the start? I always knew. It was never a question of realising I was gay. It’s just who I am.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/14/kate-scott-hughes-i-was-really-fortunate-to-start-with-the-cps-when-i-did</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/02/14/kate-scott-hughes-i-was-really-fortunate-to-start-with-the-cps-when-i-did/">&lt;p&gt;I joined the CPS in 2001, starting as an Admin Assistant in St Albans, working with the HR and facilities teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became an Admin Officer fairly quickly and within a year of starting I had progressed to working in CPS London, managing grievance cases and working on the CPS response to Employment Tribunals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the notice came around about an LGBT network being set up I knew I wanted to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only ‘out’ to one person in the office and he encouraged me to go along, saying as we finished the conversation “you should keep an eye out for Claire Scott - I think you two will get on well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out I should have asked him for the winning lottery numbers as well because within a year I had moved to York to be with Claire, with the full support of the CPS, who managed to find me a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that I could stay working in an organisation I knew and trusted, something which was very important to me as a member of the LGBT community; starting fresh can be so difficult with ‘coming out’ to a whole new organisation - that’s quite a daunting prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since moving to York I’ve been involved in so many different aspects of the CPS and the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked on victim and witness issues, hate crime, policy development, contract management and I’m currently managing the service our disabled staff receive in relation to their IT service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside that I have carried out various roles on the LGBT network committee, currently I lead the network as chair and also fulfil the role of vice-chair for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ukcsra.com&quot;&gt;Civil Service Rainbow Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (CSRA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this work gives me a whole different perspective to the Civil Service. I get to work with colleagues at all levels, from a variety of departments and disciplines, and get involved in projects that can make a difference to the estimated 20,000 people who are LGBT in the Civil Service and the services they deliver to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the project that I’m most proud of is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2014/10/01/role-models-inspiring-lgb-people-in-the-civil-service/&quot;&gt;CSRA Role Models Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s so important to have role models within an organisation. For LGBT people - who can easily feel isolated in the workplace - being able to see people like them at all levels of the organisation can be really empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been able to play a significant role in the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2015/04/13/summerskill-report-dont-ask-dont-tell-published/&quot;&gt;Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell&lt;/a&gt;” report and the resulting action plan commissioned by the Cabinet Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on both these projects contributed to being recognised with the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2015/11/01/csra-wins-diversity-award/&quot;&gt;Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp;amp; Transgender People Award&lt;/a&gt;” and day out at Buckingham Palace for the Civil Service Awards ceremony last year alongside CSRA’s chair, Ollie Entwistle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I can make my voice heard and that, by doing that, represent the views of lots of other LGB* civil servants makes me feel confident that the CPS and the Civil Service are a great place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I was really fortunate to start with the CPS when I did. Diversity issues were just beginning to be recognised and addressed, and for someone just starting out in  a Civil Service career, who is passionate about equality of opportunity and fairness, it was the right moment to join the organisation, full of fresh perspective and enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<id>https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/01/19/stonewall-workplace-equality-index-shows-civil-service-is-falling-behind-on-lgb-diversity</id>
			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2016/01/19/stonewall-workplace-equality-index-shows-civil-service-is-falling-behind-on-lgb-diversity/">&lt;p&gt;Stonewall today released the results of the 2016 Workplace Equality Index; a league table of the 100 most inclusive employers for LGBT people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of UK Civil Service organisations feature in the Index. MI5 – one of the Civil Service’s security agencies – has secured first place in the index. It’s sister organisation, MI6 also features in the Top 100, along with the Welsh Civil Service, the Office of National Statistics and a number of other agencies. The Home Office has retained Stonewall Star Performer status, having featured in the Top 10 for 3 of the last 5 years, but is now the only central Government Department to feature anywhere in the Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the release of the results, Oliver Entwistle, CSRA Chair, said, “It’s great to see so several parts of the Civil Service featuring highly in the Workplace Equality Index this year. It’s a testament to the hard work of volunteers in departmental networks across government that their employers remain in the Top 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Congratulations to MI5 and the other agencies featuring highly in the Index this year. They are a shining of example of how Civil Service organisations can actively support their LGBT staff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s encouraging to see some departments and agencies continue to carry the banner for Civil Service LGBT inclusivity; but the Civil Service shouldn’t become complacent,” CSRA Vice-Chair, Kate Scott-Hughes, commented. “These departments prove that you get out what you put in when it comes to diversity. Those departments that are taking LGBT diversity seriously are reaping the benefits. Now we need to see that effort replicated everywhere in the Civil Service.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of today’s results has also shown a number of departments and agencies falling down the rankings, or out of the Top 100 entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, CSRA worked with Ben Summerskill to produce a report - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dont-ask-dont-tell-barriers-to-career-progression-for-talented-lgbt-individuals-in-the-uk-civil-service&quot;&gt;Don’t ask, don’t tell&lt;/a&gt; - into the experiences of LGBT staff in the Civil Service. The report was the latest evidence that highlighted the need to invest in LGBT networks across the Civil Service, as well as the barriers to participation in diversity networks faced by LGBT staff. CSRA had previously published research showing similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s strong support at senior levels for making the Civil Service more inclusive as an employer,” commented Ollie Entwistle. “But we need to turn this support into real action. We used to be leading the way, now we are now falling behind other sectors. It is time to stop that decline. The Civil Service needs to provide additional support and resources for LGBT networks across government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA will be working with departments and agencies to analyse the results of the Index over the coming weeks, and understand what action needs to be taken to support LGBT staff in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full results of the Workplace Equality Index can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonewall.org.uk/get-involved/workplace/workplace-equality-index&quot;&gt;Stonewall’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/11/01/csra-wins-diversity-award/">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/&quot;&gt;Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards&lt;/a&gt; were last month. Congratulations to Ollie Entwistle and Kate Scott-Hughes who won the “Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp;amp; Transgender People Award”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp;amp; Transgender People Award” recognises an individual or team for making a real difference by improving the work experience and engagement levels of LGB&amp;amp;T colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ollie and Kate were recognised for their tremendous efforts in raising the issues that impact on civil servants who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other (LGBT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, Ollie has led in organising the Civil Service wide conference on LGBT issues – organising speakers and facilitating the day. Ollie also played a crucial role in the development of Ben Summerskill’s report, “Don’t ask, don’t tell”. He developed an effective relationship with Ben, who was able to test his emerging findings and recommendations with Ollie in a confidential way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate played a crucial role in the development of the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide by using her networks to attract a broad range of role models. This enabled LGBT civil servants from across the UK, to be included. Kate also played a leading role in organising the Civil Services’ participation in 8 Pride events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to winning the award, Ollie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was delighted to win the award with my Vice-Chair Kate for our work leading CSRA. CSRA plays a crucial role in representing and supporting LGBT civil servants across the country. In the past year we published the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide, we organised a conference on LGBT equality, and we played a crucial role in the development of Ben Summerskill’s report “Don’t ask, don’t tell” which provided a “warts ‘n’ all” assessment of the experience of LGBT civil servants. Kate and I might have led from the front in delivering all of this but we were supported by an excellent team of volunteers, so, for me, this award is also for the whole CSRA team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ollie and Kate have also been invited to attend the Civil Service Awards on 12 November at Buckingham Palace, as they have been shortlisted for the Diversity and Inclusion Award which will be presented at that event.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the past few months, we’ve been doing a lot of research into the experiences of civil servants who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or as another minority sexual orientation (LGB). We’re publishing the result of that work today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is our plan to make the Civil Service better for LGB* people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whilst the Civil Service has often been a beacon of best practice on diversity and inclusion, that progress has largely stalled. Today, we set our challenge to the Civil Service, and a set of 22 actions we’re going to take to make working for government better for those with minority sexual identities.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/09/13/pride-2015-comes-to-a-close/">&lt;p&gt;Pride season has come to an end for this year. Hundreds of civil servants - both LGBT and allies - have attended Pride events all over the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride this year kicked off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2015/06/30/civil-service-marches-at-pride-in-london/&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, where over 100 staff joined the marching group organised by CSRA - one of our largest marching groups to date. From there we moved north, to Scotland, where dozens of staff marched in Glasgow and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ukcsra.com/2015/07/07/csra-at-edinburgh-pride-2015/&quot;&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also marched in Brighton, Manchester and Newcastle alongside hundreds of other public sector workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Local networks are important for local Prides&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work CSRA does is largely done by volunteers; we rely on them to coordinate in their local areas so that civil servants have the chance to march at local Pride events. Thanks to all our volunteers for making this year’s Pride events so successful - and thanks to everyone who came along to join the marches too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t have marched at so many events without the support of local LGBT networks in government departments and agencies either. The work of local departmental networks like Spirit - the Ministry of Justice LGBT network - and FLAGG - the Foreign Office LGBT network - is essential to making Pride a success and to making #OurCivilService a great place to work for LGBT people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We'll be back next year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that the Civil Service is well represented at Pride events. Only through being representative of the diversity that exists in our country can we ensure better public service delivery; it’s important the Civil Service is visibly seen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%23championdifference&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#ChampionDifference&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why we’ll be back again next year to march at Pride events across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/06/30/csra-marches-at-pride-london/">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, more than 150 civil servants participated in the Pride in London parade. This year marked the 8th time that CSRA has led a Civil Service marching group. LGBT and straight ally staff marched together to show the inclusivity of the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Senior civil servants championing difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second time, we were pleased to be joined by the Civil Service’s LGB&amp;amp;T Diversity Champion and DCMS Permanent Secretary, Sue Owen and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary, Richard Heaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/29/new-diversity-champions-for-the-civil-service/&quot;&gt;Writing after the event&lt;/a&gt;, Sue said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Over the past year I have seen the passion and dedication that civil servants all over the country demonstrate when it comes to celebrating diversity and inclusion. On Saturday, for the second year running, I joined our Civil Service Rainbow Alliance colleagues marching at London Pride. Such events show how far we have come, but also remind us that we must continue to defend the right for all individuals to thrive and succeed, no matter their background or identity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Jeremy Heywood, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the UK Civil Service, also spoke out in support of LGBT staff on the day of the march, saying he wanted “the UK Civil Service to set the standard for diversity and inclusion” in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/27/sir-jeremy-heywood/&quot;&gt;article for Pink News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We marched together to #ChampionDifference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many civil servants, marching at Pride is the best way to show how inclusive and open the Civil Service has become in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of government departments and agencies joined the Civil Service marching groups from across the UK. It was one of the Civil Service’s largest turn outs to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vintagegaylady&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charlotte Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, who works for the Ministry of Justice, takes part in Pride to be visible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Marching at Pride is immensely important to me as a LGBT role model. I’m not just marching for myself. I march to recognise those Pride heroes who have campaigned tirelessly to ensure our rights; to remember those who are no longer with us who suffered to live their lives truthfully and experienced hatred and violence; and to show solidarity with those who may still be suffering or struggling for acceptance. It is our day to be visible and champion difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government Digital Service employee, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Peart&lt;/a&gt;, also took part in the Parade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Being part of the Civil Service block allows me, as a gay civil servant, to show I’m proud; and not just of who I am. Carrying our banner on Saturday made me incredibly proud to be part of the Civil Service too. It’s great to be part of an organisation that supports LGBT staff to be themselves in the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;We hope you all had a wonderful Pride! &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/N9leH6lZRh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/N9leH6lZRh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;We’ll be marching again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA will leading other Civil Service marching groups at Pride events across the UK this year, including Newcastle Pride in a few weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also plan on marching again at Pride in London next year - we hope you’ll join us then!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, we are publishing our annual performance report, “Delivered for you”, that sets out how we performed across our objectives over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As you will see from the report, CSRA has delivered a lot including:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Ben Summerskill to deliver his report for the Civil Service on the experiences of LGBT civil servants called “Don’t ask, don’t tell”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide&lt;/li&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/04/13/civil-service-blocks-venues-used-for-gay-cure-therapies/">&lt;p&gt;In February, we set out our concerns about some Government Departments’ &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/17/use-of-the-emmanuel-centre/&quot;&gt;use of the Emmanuel Centre&lt;/a&gt;, specifically events that promoted ‘gay cure therapies’. As we said at the time, we do not consider it appropriate for the Civil Service to use this venue. Government Department’s, and the Civil Service as a whole, have various public sector equality duties under the Equality Act to ensure that discrimination is eliminated and that equality is advanced. Hosting Civil Service events at venues like the Emmanuel Centre is not, in our view, compatible with these duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been consistently raising these concerns at the highest levels of the Civil Service and now senior managers are taking action. We can now advise that this issue was discussed at the cross-Government Heads of Diversity Board and Departments were asked to stop using this particular venue and to advise their agencies to do likewise. This message was then followed up in writing after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is already starting to have an impact with several Departments removing the Emmanuel Centre from their list of venues. If your Department hasn’t yet done so, we would encourage you to hold them to account.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/02/17/use-of-the-emmanuel-centre/">&lt;p&gt;There is serious concern about the venues being used across the Civil Service for conferences/events. It appears that some host and (importantly) organise events that CSRA would consider to be homophobic. This has the effect of making some LGB* staff  deeply uncomfortable about attending Civil Service events at these venues. For example, at a recent away day, some CSRA members chose to boycott the event, which was unfortunate because it meant they did not join their colleagues for an election planning session and because they had to have awkward conversations with their management chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue that is causing the most concern is the Emmanuel Centre situated across the road from the Home Office.  In the past 5 years they have organised 17 events that we would consider offensive including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2014&lt;/strong&gt; – an event aimed at helping debunk the myth that same-sex attraction happens and gives tips on how to prevent ‘unwanted homosexual feelings’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2013&lt;/strong&gt; – sexual re-orientation therapy – proposing that people can somehow ‘be cured’ and been ‘re-oriented to heterosexuality’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2012&lt;/strong&gt; – an event entitled ‘The Leper amongst us’ which talks about how same sex sins are ‘a disease of epic proportions’ and how the sinners should be treated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA has raised this issue with Sue Owen, the Civil Service LGBT champion, and with senior management in the Departments using this venue. There is a question here, that needs to be answered: how can a venue, such as the Emmanuel Centre, be on an ‘approved list’ of venues for use by the Civil Service given Department’s public sector duties under the Equality Act?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA will be discussing this with Sue Owen in our next regular meeting with her, and we will keep you updated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2015/01/14/home-office-achieves-star-performer-in-stonewall-index/">&lt;p&gt;The Home Office has achieved ‘Star Performer’ status in a Workplace Equality Index compiled by Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranking was awarded in recognition of the fact that the Home Office has consistently been in the top ten of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_work/stonewall_top_100_employers/&quot;&gt;Stonewall Workplace Equality Index&lt;/a&gt; (WEI) over the last five years. The WEI lists the top 100 employers based on an annual benchmarking exercise using Stonewall’s criteria as a model for good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-10&quot;&gt;Top 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking part in the WEI is an effective way to measure employers’ efforts to tackle discrimination and create an inclusive workplace for lesbian, gay and bisexual employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2014 WEI saw the Home Office achieve joint fifth place with Ernst &amp;amp; Young (EY) out of 369 employers. The Home Office was the highest scoring government department and third out of 200 public sector organisations who took part in 2014. Employers were assessed against eight evaluation criteria, including a staff feedback questionnaire for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pushing-for-equality&quot;&gt;Pushing for equality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Anderson, Home Office champion for sexual orientation, said, ‘It is a great privilege to be offered Star Performer status, especially as we are the only government department in the eight organisations who have attained this status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It will give us more chance to focus on LGBT objectives throughout everything we deliver as a department and to push hard for equality for LGBT staff and people who deal directly with the Home Office, for example, those seeking asylum. We have work to do to meet these challenging objectives.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Harris, chair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://horizon.fcos.gsi.gov.uk/section/hr-and-learning/staff-support-networks-and-unions/spectrum&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Home Office network for LGBT staff, said:  “Star Performer status will hopefully give us a renewed impetus to push for LGBT equality in the workplace and to serve as an inspirational example to other organisations.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;publication-description&quot;&gt;Publication description&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the first ever Civil Service wide role model guide that features lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other staff with a minority sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This guide celebrates the positive role that LGB civil servants play across the whole Civil Service is great progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The guide has been created to send a clear, visible signal to all civil servants that it’s okay to be yourself in the Civil Service. It is important that everyone understands that you can be LGB and be successful in your career; that you can be LGB and be open, if you wish, about your life outside work; and that you can be LGB and be a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The role models featured in this guide are from a broad range of Departments and their arm’s length bodies. Everyone featured is a volunteer, so if your Department is not featured then that is not because LGB role models do not exist within your organisation. We have also tried to reflect the diversity of the Civil Service in this guide. This means we have role models from across the grades, across locations, across job functions, and of course, across different sexual orientations – including allies.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/archives/2014/10/01/csra-publishes-role-models-guide/">&lt;p&gt;On 1 October 2014, CSRA published the first ever Civil Service role models guide for LGBT staff - &lt;strong&gt;Role models: inspring LGBT people in the Civil Service&lt;/strong&gt; - at an event hosted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide features staff who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other minority sexual orientations, such as asexual. It features role models of all grades from AO to Permanent Secretary. It also has role models from many different parts of the UK, as well as those working overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSRA produced this guide because every lesbian, gay, bisexual or person with a minority sexual orientation has to make a decision about whether to be open about their sexual orientation in the workplace. This isn’t a one off event either. Each time they move to a new job, recruit new staff, or engage with stakeholders, they to decide whether to be open or not. This can be a difficult process for some. By having visible LGBT role models set out in this guide we can send a clear signal that in the Civil Service you can be yourself. You can be authentic. You don’t have to worry about the impact of disclosing your sexual orientation on your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the launch of the CSRA role models guide, Sue Owen, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This role models guide sends a clear, visible, signal to all civil servants that it’s okay to be yourself in the Civil Service. It is important that everyone understands that you can be LGBT and be successful in your career; that you can be LGBT and be open, if you wish, about your life outside work; and that you can be LGBT and be a leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chair of CSRA, Ollie Entwistle, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am very proud to be launching this guide today. The Civil Service really has come a long way on sexual orientation equality. I hope that this guide helps inspire a future generation of LGBT people to work for the Civil Service and that it encourages those in the Civil Service to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I would also like to thank all those who appeared in the guide, and those who helped produce it, for without their dedication this guide would not have been possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

The event explored experiences of coming out in each of the decades since the end of World War II, and tied into LGBT History Month’s “music” theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was chaired by Baroness Barker, who is Liberal Democrat spokesperson on health matters and open Lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event opened with Baroness Barker exploring how music has been a vehicle for the expression of sexual identity for a long time, sharing some of her own experiences and favourite songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;Off to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCSRA&quot;&gt;@UKCSRA&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OpeningDoorsLdn&quot;&gt;@OpeningDoorsLdn&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LGBTHM&quot;&gt;@LGBTHM&lt;/a&gt; event.

&lt;p&gt;CSRA Chair, Oliver Entwistle, shared a brief overview of LGBT History running up to the end of World War II, and introduced speakers from Opening Doors and the Civil Service. Each of the speakers shared their coming out experiences, and how music punctuated those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;Guest speaker, David Mitchell, talks about high levels of police harassment in the 1950s but also shifting attitudes in wider society&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;mdash; CSRA UK (@UKCSRA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UKCSRA/statuses/438738120239235072&quot;&gt;February 26, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;Vito telling us about growing up in N.East. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;“I’m not afraid of anybody anymore.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;Gavin telling us how the music of the Pet Shop Boys empowered him as a young LGBT person in the 80/90s. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23csra2014&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#csra2014&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;mdash; John Peart (@johnpeart) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart/statuses/438743210870210560&quot;&gt;February 26, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event closed with CSRA’s chair reminding us that the story has not yet been finished, with many countries around the world still having laws against being LGBT, and many societies closer to home not being very accepting of LGBT people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;CSRA Chair, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OllieEntwistle&quot;&gt;@OllieEntwistle&lt;/a&gt;, giving us “pause for thought”, as he highlights the march for equality is far from finished. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23csra2014&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#csra2014&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;mdash; John Peart (@johnpeart) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnpeart/statuses/438747559587504128&quot;&gt;February 26, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGBT History Month is an annual event, held in February, that raises the profile of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* people throughout history and highlights their contribution to society.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;about-this-document&quot;&gt;About this document&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance (now the Civil Service LGBT+ Network) published a report into the experiences of LGB&amp;amp;T civil servants in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The document drew on research carried out independently over 2010 and 2011, as well as using Civil Service People Survey data and industry benchmarking information in order to get a picture of the culture of the Civil Service and the barriers to career development that LGB&amp;amp;T civil servants experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 100 page report is the first document we know of that specifically looked at the experiences of LGB&amp;amp;T civil servants separately from non-LGB&amp;amp;T civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;
