				<p>I am not going to talk about what bisexuality is, as my friend <a href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/09/20/bi-mark">Mark</a> and the <a href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/bi-fact-sheet">Bisexuality Fact Sheet</a> have already done an excellent job of that. Instead Iâ€™m going to share my experience of coming out as bi at work over the last year.</p>

<p>Last year on Bi Visibility Day I made a resolution to myself that I would spend the coming year being more visible. I made that decision for a number of reasons. Partly because I was tired of feeling like I was constantly hiding part of myself. And partly because I read a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/bullied-bisexual-prison-officer-ben-plaistow-unlikely-work-again-tribunal">case</a> about a bisexual civil servant who was bullied and harassed for who he was, which deeply upset me and made me feel a certain sense of moral obligation to make myself visible to support my fellow bi civil servants.</p>

<p>I was unsure how I was going to achieve that, particularly as I am often shy in social situations and had not previously felt comfortable talking about personal matters at work. I was also conscious that although my office had LGBT-inclusive policies, there were few visible LGBT+ staff members and as a result LGBT+ issues were seldom talked about.</p>

<p>A few months later I bought myself a lanyard in the colours of the Bi Pride flag (pink, purple and blue) to wear my work ID on, in the hope that this would be a subtle way of being visible, at least to other bi people who might recognise the colours. I was extremely nervous the first day I wore my new lanyard to the office, wondering whether people would notice and ask what it was. To my dismay exactly that happened two hours later when, in a crowded lift full of people, a colleague commented on the lanyard and asked me what it was. I awkwardly explained that it was a Pride symbol, that I felt there was not enough visibility in our office and that I hoped to lead by example. There followed a period of silence before we all got off the lift. Not exactly how I imagined my first morning of being visible to go but it was a start.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I decided to write a blog post for my officeâ€™s intranet about bi visibility and why I felt it was important at work. As we had no LGBT network, I didnâ€™t know who to turn to for support, so I eventually asked a friendly colleague I felt I could trust, for whose support I remain extremely grateful. I then submitted it to the communications team, who could not have been more supportive and encouraging.</p>

<p>The post was eventually published at the beginning of this year. I have seldom been as anxious as I was on the day it went up â€“ I am used to dealing with all manner of acrimonious situations in my day job but sharing such a personal part of myself to 500 people was definitely outside my usual comfort zone.</p>

<p>To my delight I received numerous messages of support from colleagues across my office who had read and appreciated what I wrote. It started a number of conversations about LGBT+ issues that had not previously been talked about. From those conversations a few colleagues and I decided to launch an LGBT+ network. It turned out that a lot of people were happy to see us finally have a network, everyone was just waiting for someone else to take the first step.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m glad I took the step of coming out at work. It took a lot of mental effort and involved a significant amount of self-doubt but now that itâ€™s done it feels like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders to no longer hide such a big part of who I am from my colleagues. Or in corporate HR jargon, I now feel able to bring my whole self to work. It has also allowed me to connect with other bi+ civil servants through <a href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/bispace/">BiSpace</a>, get involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Networkâ€™s <a href="https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/our-team/bi-inclusion/">Bi+ Inclusion Team</a>, host a virtual discussion on how to be bi and visible at work, and guest speak at a bi visibility event at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.</p>

<p>Whether to come out at work is a deeply personal decision that everyone needs to make based on their personal circumstances. For me doing it was one of the best professional decisions I have made and I hope that I can provide the visibility and support that allows other bi+ civil servants to do the same should they wish to.</p>
