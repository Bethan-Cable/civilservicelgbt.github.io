I work as an Investigator at the Serious Fraud Office. For many years I felt unable to be out about my bisexual identity, in part because there were no visible bi people where I work. I eventually wrote a blog post about bi visibility that was published on my departmentâ€™s intranet around the same time that I joined the Bi+ Inclusion Team. I have since helped create an LGBT+ Network where I work, which I now co-chair. I am keen to take an active role to improve LGBT+, and in particular bisexual, visibility and inclusion in the Civil Service to ensure that people feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work.
