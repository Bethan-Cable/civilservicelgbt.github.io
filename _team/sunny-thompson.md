I volunteered because I feel passionately about bi inclusion, being married to someone of another gender and living in a rural community with no “scene” I am exceptionally invisible! After 16 years in the Rural Payments Agency, and a long time as Defra’s bi rep and LGBAT network vice-chair, I moved onto the Fast Stream, rather unusual for someone in their forties. I have rotated through three more departments in a short space of time, bi+ people can often face coming out as a constant process and I have been surprised how difficult that was after building up a level of comfort and confidence in my original department. I am currently at the Valuations Office Agency but will move onto another placement in October 2021 for my third Fast Stream year.
