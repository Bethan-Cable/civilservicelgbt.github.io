Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John, and I'm the Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

In my day job, Iâ€™m a Bill Manager in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Prior to my current role, I've worked in a number of departments, including the Government Equalities Office where I was Head of Sexual Orientation policy, and the Government Digital Service.

I was Vice-Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network from October 2017 to 2019, and from April 2021 to October 2021.

Iâ€™ve been involved in the cross government network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; helping to deliver our Role Models guide and LGBT Impact Index, developing the networkâ€™s digital presence, and leading our Pride activities.
