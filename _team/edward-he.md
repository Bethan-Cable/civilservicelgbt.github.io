I joined Civil Service in 2019 as a Chartered Engineer, having previously worked in higher education, R&D, the steelworks, oil & gas and aviation industries. I currently serve as one of the Vice Chairs for our Civil Service LGBT+ Network, a university career mentor, a STEM Ambassador and a trustee for a cancer support charity in South Wales. I am also a proud Welsh learner and speaker. I am keen to support our LGBT+ colleagues from different professional, religious and ethnical backgrounds and help create a culture within the Civil Service where we can truly be ourselves, value our similarities and appreciate our differences. I want to be part of this exciting transformation!
