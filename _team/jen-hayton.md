Greetings, my name is Jen and I’m a thirty-five-year-old lesbian. The journey to acceptance has been a long road for me due to my Catholic upbringing and it’s only been in the last five years or so that I’ve felt comfortable enough to express who I am. It’s important to me to continually be an active part in the community as I feel it has given me the chance to be around people who understand my struggles and in turn give me the opportunity to listen to others. I am a mental health first aider with APHA and have a passion about mental health in the LBGTQ+ community. I look forward to working with you and expressing my pride and passion for the LGBTQ+ community.
