title: "Pride in our crafts: using art to make us visible"
excerpt: Crafts have had a radical history within the LGBT+ community, from making our own clothes and flags to designing pride protest signs to baking rainbow cakes, it has been a way to express and enjoy our identity. As part of the Civil Service network’s PrideON events, our volunteers have organised some events so that you can craft-along at home.

## Pride On Events

We are holding three crafting events, on Tuesday June 16th we will be holding a [bake-a-long to create your own rainbow roses](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-16-bake-along-pride-on/). And then on Friday June 26th, we are organising a [rainbow basket making session](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-26-rainbow-basket-pride-on/) and a [showcase for walls of Pride](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2020-06-26-walls-of-pride-pride-on/). So come and join us, and celebrate your pride!

## Crafts in the LGBT Community 

Looking at images from past [pride parades](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39466318/amazing-images-of-the-rainbow-flag-around-the-world), you can often see a sea of homemade flags, signs and outfits. The sewing machine Gilbert Baker used to make the first flag is now in a museum! Underrepresented groups have also used crafts to recreate and reinvent the images of the LGBT+ movements, [adding stripes to represent people of colour](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/inclusive-pride-flag-confronting-racism-lgbt) and including the [chevron of the trans flag](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/06/12/daniel-quasar-lgbt-rainbow-flag-inclusive/). 

Crafts have also played an important part in LGBT+ protests, the [British Museum has collected over 400 badges](https://www.britishmuseum.org/wear-pride-lgbtq-badges-british-museum) from hundreds of organisations to record the history of campaigns and protest in the UK. The [National AIDS memorial quilt in the US](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2011/06/collecting-an-epidemic-the-aids-memorial-quilt.html) was crafted as a very personal tribute, with panels often featuring bright colours and sequins.

## Personal stories from volunteers
- "Particularly as a LGBT+ woman who struggles to be publicly out I’ve found that crafting is a great way for me to connect with other people in the community and show my pride." - Clare R 
- "I’m part of a queer yarn group that meets once a month. I really like being part of a queer community in a way that isn’t about bars and pubs, and it made talking to people when I joined the group much easier, since we have our projects to talk about." - Emily S
- "I discovered basketry nearly two decades after finishing college. In it I recognised a set of constructional techniques that could be used to make really complex objects out of mundane materials (paper, string, recycled stuff) without loads of specialist equipment. I wanted to make the rainbow basket partly to get involved with the Pride celebrations, partly just to prove to myself that I could do it and partly to show fellow members of the LGBT+ community what kinds of things are possible and that while basketry might seem old fashioned, you really can use it to express yourself!" - Gareth W
