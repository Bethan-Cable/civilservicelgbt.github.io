### Transcript: 

Pride is such an important part of the LGBTI+ calendar.

This year we can’t organise events  in the way we normally would. 

But Pride is just as important as ever, if not even more during these times so we are determined to celebrate LGBTI+ colleagues 

That’s why the Civil Service LGBT+ Network has organised a whole series of digital events and content for the whole month of June. 

They like me, are determined to celebrate Pride and keep PrideON. 

So whether you are into quizzes, or photography or baking or any of the other sort of events organised by the network log on to www.civilservice.lgbt/pride

Sign up as quickly as possible because the events are going fast.

There’s an online exercise class with a special guest, there’s a book club, a podcast, all sorts of stuff that will help us together to celebrate pride and keep PrideON. 

> PrideON is a programme of digital events and content across the month of June to help celebrate Pride in the Civil Service. Do you have a digital event or content that you want us to share? [Contact us](/about/contact-us/).
