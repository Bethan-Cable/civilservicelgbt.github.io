While we can’t physically march this year, we need your help to create the Civil Service PrideON virtual pride parade. 

Please send us your photos of how you are celebrating pride this year, whether you are taking part in our PrideON events or celebrating ‘socially distanced’ with friends – we want to see your photos! 

We would also love to see your photos from previous years – do you have a photo from your first pride parade, or your favourite pride memory? Send them over! 

We will collate them into a slideshow to launch at the end of the month – so together we can keep #PrideON. 

Please send any photos to [info@civilservice.lgbt](info@civilservice.lgbt), with a brief description and date taken.   

> PrideON is a programme of digital events and content across the month of June to help celebrate Pride in the Civil Service. Do you have a digital event or content that you want us to share? [Contact us](/about/contact-us/).
