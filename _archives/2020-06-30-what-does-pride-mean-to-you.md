What does pride mean to you? 

### Transcript: 

*Person 1:* Pride for me is an opportunity for all of the LGBT plus community to  come together, to celebrate our inclusion in the community and to also celebrate our differences.

*Person 2:* It should be that simple. There shouldn't be questions. People should be able to be who they are, without discrimination without question.

*Person 3:*  Well, it's a celebration. It's usually a hell of a party. But it's also a reminder that the job's not done, there's an awful lot more still to do before we get anywhere close to genuine equality.

*Person 4:* There's a lot of people on this planet. As a parent it's really important to me to raise my boy to be kind and tolerant. It seems ridiculous and petty to treat people differently because of who they choose to love.

*Person 5:* It's a safe space for you to go. Pride is like a big hug; You will find your people and they will be entirely welcoming to you. It's just a really special thing to have. 

*Person 6:* It is a celebration, a celebration of people, all people. Where people would like to live in a world of respect, consideration, support and love.

*Person 7:* For me pride is an important time of the year. It's a celebration of the LGBT plus community, and a reminder of our ongoing struggle for rights and freedoms within the UK and the wider world. Pride for me isn't just partying and music, it's more than that. It's an opportunity to celebrate LGBT plus history, culture, activism and life experience. We march because we can and for those who cannot.

*Person 8:* For me pride is a celebration of equality and diversity. And whilst those celebrations will take on a very different form this year, I still think we have cause to sit back and reflect on how far we've come, where we're heading, and take a moment to celebrate the progress that we've all made.

*Person 9:* Pride for me is inclusion, acknowledging, and more importantly, accepting someone's true self. Whether that is gender identity or sexuality. It gives them the confidence and support to live their true lives.

*Person 10:* For me pride is about being who you are. Accepting who you are, and being proud of who you are. It's about saying this is me, and Iâ€™m proud to be me.

*Person 11:* Pride means to me a very visible recognition of the challenges and struggles faced by LGBT plus colleagues. And also a very visible response to those challenges and struggles. Through which we can help create a truly inclusive workplace, where we can all be the best versions of ourselves.
