### Transcript: 

Hi, I’m Menna Rawlings, I’m the diversity and inclusion champion on the foreign office board and I’m also very proud to say I’m an Ally of the LGBTQ+ community - as you can see from my badge which was given to me by my daughter who happens to be queer and that’s just one of the many reasons that I want to support the community as we approach the month of pride and just let you know that I am thinking of you. 

I know that colleagues across the civil service will not be able to celebrate pride in the same way as usual and I know that’s sad, but hopefully by next year we’ll be back to celebrating it in the normal way with marches and parties. But for now I hope quietly we can still celebrate the month of pride and what it stands for in terms of defending and promoting the rights of LGBTQ+ staff in the Civil Service and across our Diplomatic Network around the world. 

So that’s it really, I just wanted you to know that your allies are thinking of you and are with you in these COVID times and Happy Pride Month.
