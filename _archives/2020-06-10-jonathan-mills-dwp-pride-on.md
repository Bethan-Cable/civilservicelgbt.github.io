### Transcript: 

Hello, my name is Jonathan Mills and I’ve got the great honour of being the champion in DWP and my message in a time like this as a proud ally - is first, let’s keep looking out for each other. Now more than ever it’s really important that we are looking after each other, supporting each other, helping each other with our mental health and our wellbeing. 

Second, don’t let anyone tell you that just because of everything else that’s on we should not be lowering our ambitions, letting our standards slip, we need to keep challenging ourselves to being the most diverse, inclusive civil service that we can be. And then last but not least at all, keep finding ways of coming together as a community of being together and that’s why Pride is so important, a way of remembering all the challenges the communities have faced down the years. 

Such a great way of renewing the energy we need to face the challenges that we’ve got today. So good luck and look forward to being on the journey with you.
