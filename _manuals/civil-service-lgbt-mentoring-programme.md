The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a career development offer developed and led by the *Civil Service LGBT+ Network*. 

## About this publication

This is a guidance document. It reflects the process by which the mentoring programme has been administered so far. The intended audience for the document is volunteers who are looking to replicate and improve upon this process.

This document was last updated on 2 January 2022.

## Purpose of the programme

The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme was created for two reasons:

1. to support LGBT+ civil servants in developing their career
2. to create greater visibility of LGBT+ role models throughout the Civil Service

The cross-government LGBT+ network conducted [research into the career progression of LGBT+ civil servants](/publication/2011/10/01/career-development-for-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-civil-servants) in 2011. The research found that respondents felt they didn’t have access to the same career and development opportunities as their straight or cisgendered counterparts. Mentoring was one development opportunity that was cited and has been consistently asked for.

We also know from engagement with LGBT+ staff over a number of years that they felt it was difficult to identify LGBT+ role models across government. The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** has tried to address this through our [Role Models guide](/publication/2014/10/01/role-models-inspiring-lgb-people-in-the-civil-service/) and [Impact Index](/publication/2017/10/30/civil-service-impact-index/) previously.

This programme aims to address both issues simultaneously. It provides mentees to access to structured mentoring opportunities with staff who are at least one grade more senior than them.

## What you will need

This programme was designed to be delivered at low or no cost but it is relatively time intensive. 

### Tools

The first iteration of the programme was delivered entirely online using the following tools:

- Google Workspace (Google Mail, Meet, Sheets, Forms and Slides) — to manage correspondence, registrations, matching, surveys and online induction
- GOV.UK Notify — to send transactional emails to participants

At the time of the original programme, Google Workspace cost around £10 per month. The costs were met by the Chair. GOV.UK Notify’s email service is free-to-use for the Civil Service.

There is no specific reason why the programme could not have been delivered using alternative tools.

### Time

The first iteration of the programme programme took around 45 hours to create and around 20 hours to administer. This included:

- 15 hours to create guidance documents
- 5 hours to create induction presentation materials
- 5 hours to create notification email templates, forms and surveys
- 20 hours to conduct matching of mentors to mentees
- 5 hours to notify participants and provide follow up advice
- 10 hours to conduct induction events
- 5 hours to review feedback and survey data
- regular email correspondence with prticipants

## Feedback and reviewing the programme

You should gather feedback from participants throughout the programme. This feedback will help to improve the programme as it takes place and to inform changes for the next round.

During the first round of the programme, three surveys were created to gather feedback. The surveys contained a mixture of qualitative and quantitative questions.

The surveys took place:

1. **before speed mentoring started** so we could get feedback about the induction mentors and mentees received, to understand the participants existing skills and confidence, and to understand the demographics of the participants
2. **after speed mentoring had taken place** so that we could assess whether the speed mentoring process had worked as intended and gauge whether people felt they had seen an immediate benefit from the programme
3. **after long-term mentoring had taken place for a few months** so that we could assess whether the programme continued to have its intended outputs and whether people felt they had seen a benefit from their mentoring relationship

Each survey remained open for 1 month. The survey was posted on the **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** website and also emailed to all participants.

These surveys were each conducted via Google Forms and are linked below. These forms will no longer accept responses but can be granted on a case-by-case basis.
